Dear Professor,

My name is Yuan Gao, I am a fourth-year undergraduate in China,
majoring in Automobile Engineering. I have a strong wish to pursue an
M.A. degree in Asian Studies at U.C. Berkeley, because the
interdisciplinary nature of GAP with its valuable and powerful
resources really fascinates me.

I am proficient in both modern and ancient Chinese, and I can read a
little German and Japanese. Besides, I am interested in various areas
such as Art, Literature, Sociology, Political Science, Music(I study
and listen to a great measure of Chinese and Japanese music, both
traditional and avant-garde, and a great number of Indian classical
music too) and Buddism(I have been studying Buddism for a few years
and being a Buddist myself). I also believe that I have an aptitude
for culture study with great academic potential.

It is one of my concerns that the irrelevancy of my current major to
the Asian Studies would diminish my competitiveness when applying to
GAS. If this is true, would you please let me know if there was any
precedent of successful application similar to my case? Is there any
way, for example, a strong statement of purpose or sample of academic
writing, would help increase my competitiveness?

Best wishes,

Yuan, Gao

The important qualities of a good roomate



We become more independent and learn more life experience while live without
families, but your roommates. However, to live with other people is neither
easy nor difficult. You should learn how to be a good roommate, basically.



Believe or not, dormitory life is a extremly happy thing. You make new
friends, experience independece, difficulties and enjoy the freedom. But all
of these are base on your behaves as a good roommate.



Firstly, you should know how to respect people. Not only your roommate, also
people around you. It is the most important factor in our communications.
Whatever what is your background, you are the same as your roommates, you
guys are all equal. To respect your roommate, respect their religions and
cultures. Do not laugh at enthetic people or racism. That is rude and
stupid. We should respect what God created for us. Besides, you must respect
your roommates' privately, everyone have right to have their secrets.



Take your duty and responsibility. You can not ingore and think about those
are negligible. Do not tend to ask your mates to do things what you have to
do. Remember, no one will like a lazy and irresponsible roommate. In
general, you should help to cleaning, put litter bags to dustheap, put
things back after you used .To be quite when others are studying, take care
of your men is another factor among.



In addition, You are one of members of your dormitory. Do not hide yourself
behind, you are buddy of your roommates. Try to share your ideas, experience
of study and life, your happiness etc. And you listen to your mates
experience as well. Take care of your mates You dormitory will be lively
then.



All in all, as long as you enjoy your dormitory life, get well with your
friends, then you should be a good roommate. Whatever what you experiences,
those of them will be a beautiful memorial of your rest of life. TRY IT.

Subject: sublet
Hi there,

I read on the craigslist that you're subletting a room near Columbia.

A quick/stupid question: must the sublet last thru Aug 31? Cos ideally I'd
be looking for a new apt on mid-July.

Please let me know, thanks.

Subject: Re: sublet
Hi Johan,

Yes, I'm certainly able to move in the first of May.

I'd suggest that I book the room for May and June first, and let you know
if I could stay longer prior to mid June. Does that sound ok to you?

Let me briefly say something about myself. I graduated from EE Columbia
last year, worked a whole year in LA, and just moved back to New York, with
a plan to go to NYU on Sep. I seldom cook, most of the time eat out. I'm
quite, and clean. I don't drink. Highly respect others' privacy.

If it's ok with you, I hope I can go see the apartment tomorrow and if it's
good, I'll reserve the room.

Thanks.

Any time before 5pm is good. Are you going to be at home in the afternoon?
I can get there by 3pm.

Are you going to graduate school in NYU? What's your major? I want to apply
for Tisch ITP in NYU, but still pondering because of the appallingly high
tuition...

Most creative protest ever: 50 cent bills rained on Yunnan's super censor W=
u Hao - Shanghaiist
It's raining cash on Yunnan propaganda official Wu Hao )=
 NetEase tells us of the most creative and harmonious protest we have ever =
seen in all our years here:April 22 -- This afternoon, Wu Hao ), the deputy director of the Yunnan arrived at the live recording st=
udio of the Renmin University to give a lecture. At 2pm, after the host of =
the event gave the audience an introduction of Wu Hao, Wu stepped on stage =
and proceeded to start with his presentation. But he had barely started wit=
h his lecture when a 25 year old youth went on stage, and threw a stack of =
50 cent bills at him, shouting, "Wu Hao! Wu mao!" [Editor's note: Wu mao me=
ans 50 cents in Chinese]. Later in the day, a Chengdu journalist managed to=
 get in touch with the young protestor, a Wang Zhongxia who says he is a Re=
nmin University graduate. Wang says in the morning, he went to the bank to =
exchange 30RMB worth of bills to "shower Wu Hao with respect". Subsequent a=
ttempts to get in touch with Wu Hao via phone calls and text messages went =
answered. [Translation by Shanghaiist]

Note: The term "50 Cent Party" , wumaodang] ref=
ers to paid internet commentators whose job is to post comments favourable =
to the government in order to skew public perception of policy. Word on the=
 street has it that each commentator is paid about 50 cents per post.

DJ,

Thanks!!! you ARE my man!!

I've been studying analog circuits and analog amps these days,
extremely exhausting and difficult for me. My life has been constrained fro=
m
every interesting events out there, including tonight's Budos Band live. I
can't even spare the time for the newly purchased Zero History(damn I wanna
read it so bad)! Hope I will be free for the poetry reading, so many big
names...

Wish you an extraordinary weekend.

Dear DJ,

Happy new year!

Things been changing for me soon as the new year began. Lately I felt this
urge to stop nail-biting and cigarette smoking at all. Plus I've met a girl
not long ago that I kinda fell for, and we went to see the movie Her
tonight (highly recommended by Hollywood standards). 2014 might bring
something good for me, hopefully.

Glad to hear that you're enjoying some leisure after all the hardworking.
Miss you much.

As for myself, I've been planning with GX on a new social-networking
platform, highly motivated now to get it done in the next few months.
Firstly we need to find some engineers to put up a team on this side of
earth. Actually I'm going back to China on Wed this week for chinese new
year, will elaborate on the idea later :)

I will get the book now and have it shipped to my place (will get me a copy
also). GX can help me send it back to China. The Keith Jarrett - No End CD
I have sent out weeks ago should arrive at your place soon.

Cheers, and hope we have a chance to meet up during chinese new year.

GY

Dear Silicon Labs,



My name is Yuan Gao and I am a first year graduate student at Columbia
University, learning Electrical Engineering. I would like to apply for your
Electrical Engineering Summer Intern position.



I believe I am fit for the position because of my strong analytical skills,
my creativity, and my communications ability. Studying Automotive
Engineering in Tongji University, China, I was a challenge-seeker all the
time. I joined a Formula SAE project in Tongji University, with the purpose
of designing and building a small Formula-style race car, and actively
participated in its layout, assembly and testing process to see its birth.
In parallel with that project, I was also a member of the engineering
department of the 2015 PACE China's Concept Car Project(initiated by General
Motors), and was responsible for using CAX software to design, draw and
analyze different auto components, e.g. transmission components. Besides all
the engineering work, I also assisted my fellow members in the marketing
department to conduct market analysis and to come up with marketing
strategies, with the aim of gaining more insights into the business world
and the industry itself. The project went well and we managed to give a
successful presentation of the whole idea. Furthermore, in my senior year,
my broadened interest in Electrical Engineering led me to finish a more
electronic-wise graduation project, designing a simulation device for the
testing of the Battery Management System of vehicles. The project involved
design and simulation of the schematic, drawing the PCB, and debugging the
circuit board after it was made. With that challenging experience I decided
to devote myself for further study in Electrical Engineering, a choice
inherently corresponded to my adventurous nature.


Silicon Labs appeals to me because the diversity and pace of learning it can
offer is truly unique, with exposure to the cutting-edge technologies and a
wide range of industries and areas. I am looking for an environment where I
can constantly learn new things, maximize my potential, and have fun as
well. Most importantly, I am passionate about ICs as well as its audio
applications, and I find Silicon Labs, with strong background high
reputation in this filed, being the most suitable place for me to start my
career.



I believe with my passion, I would fit well in Arup.



Sincerely,


Yuan Gao

Hello,

Namgar is such a wonderful band. I live in New York and I wonder is there  
any place I can find your CDs in NYC? Or can I buy them directly from your  
website?

Cheers

Dear Silicon Labs,



My name is Yuan Gao and I am a first year graduate student at Columbia
University, learning Electrical Engineering. I would like to apply for your
Electrical Engineering Summer Intern position.



I believe I am fit for the position because of my strong analytical skills,
my creativity, and my communications ability. Studying Automotive
Engineering in Tongji University, China, I was a challenge-seeker all the
time. I joined a Formula SAE project in Tongji University, with the purpose
of designing and building a small Formula-style race car, and actively
participated in its layout, assembly and testing process to see its birth.
In parallel with that project, I was also a member of the engineering
department of the 2015 PACE China's Concept Car Project(initiated by General
Motors), and was responsible for using CAX software to design, draw and
analyze different auto components, e.g. transmission components. Besides all
the engineering work, I also assisted my fellow members in the marketing
department to conduct market analysis and to come up with marketing
strategies, with the aim of gaining more insights into the business world
and the industry itself. The project went well and we managed to give a
successful presentation of the whole idea. Furthermore, in my senior year,
my broadened interest in Electrical Engineering led me to finish a more
electronic-wise graduation project, designing a simulation device for the
testing of the Battery Management System of vehicles. The project involved
design and simulation of the schematic, drawing the PCB, and debugging the
circuit board after it was made. With that challenging experience I decided
to devote myself for further study in Electrical Engineering, a choice
inherently corresponded to my adventurous nature.


Silicon Labs appeals to me because the diversity and pace of learning it can
offer is truly unique, with exposure to the cutting-edge technologies and a
wide range of industries and areas. I am looking for an environment where I
can constantly learn new things, maximize my potential, and have fun as
well. Most importantly, I am passionate about ICs as well as its audio
applications, and I find Silicon Labs being the most suitable place for me
to start my career in this field.



I believe with my passion, I would fit well in Arup.



Sincerely,


Yuan Gao

Subject: Re: Exam
Hello Professor,

I have a question about problem 2 (b). In this problem, are we asked to
design K and L first, then do another problem trying to stabilize the
airplane with the condition that "Since you bought a Energy Star...", or, w=
e
have to take the condition into consideration before we design K and L? I'm
just not sure about that.

Thanks

Professor,

About problem 3(e), I wonder is it actually the same question as 3(b)?

Thanks

Dear MathWorks,



My name is Yuan Gao and I am a first year graduate student at Columbia
University, learning Electrical Engineering. I would like to apply for your
Application Support Engineer Intern position.



I believe I am fit for the position because of my strong analytical skills,
my creativity, and my communications ability. Studying Automotive
Engineering in Tongji University, China, I was a challenge-seeker all the
time. I joined a Formula SAE project in Tongji University, with the purpose
of designing and building a small Formula-style race car, and actively
participated in its layout, assembly and testing process to see its birth.
In parallel with that project, I was also a member of the engineering
department of the 2015 PACE China's Concept Car Project(initiated by Genera=
l
Motors), and was responsible for using CAX software to design, draw and
analyze different auto components, e.g. transmission components. Besides al=
l
the engineering work, I also assisted my fellow members in the marketing
department to conduct market analysis and to come up with marketing
strategies, with the aim of gaining more insights into the business world
and the industry itself. The project went well and we managed to give a
successful presentation of the whole idea. Furthermore, in my senior year,
my broadened interest in Electrical Engineering led me to finish a more
electronic-wise graduation project, designing a simulation device for the
testing of the Battery Management System of vehicles. The project involved
designing and simulation of the schematic, drawing the PCB, and debugging
the circuit board after it was made. With that challenging experience I
decided to devote myself for further study in Electrical Engineering, a
choice inherently corresponded to my adventurous nature.


MathWorks appeals to me because the diversity and pace of learning it can
offer is truly unique, with exposure to a wide range of industries and
areas. I am looking for an environment where I can constantly learn new
things, maximize my potential, and have fun as well. More importantly, I am
passionate about new concepts and practices in today's engineering world, a=
s
well as the realization of every creative thought. What attracts me most is
the fact that MathWorks provides the most essential tools and solutions for
every meaningful step in this world, forms a solid basis for its constant
development, and keeps influencing and changing the way people engineer. I
think MathWorks would be the best matrix for me to start my career.



I believe with my passion, I would fit well in MathWorks.



Sincerely,


Yuan Gao

wires are not included in both cases and I really got no idea of what kind

Dear Arup,



My name is Yuan Gao and I am a first year graduate student at Columbia
University, learning Electrical Engineering. I would like to apply for your
Electrical Engineering Summer Intern position.



I believe I am fit for the position because of my strong analytical skills,
my creativity, and my communications ability. Studying Automotive
Engineering in Tongji University, China, I was a challenge-seeker all the
time. I joined a Formula SAE project in Tongji University, with the purpose
of designing and building a small Formula-style race car, and actively
participated in its layout, assembly and testing process to see its birth.
In parallel with that project, I was also a member of the engineering
department of the 2015 PACE China's Concept Car Project(initiated by Genera=
l
Motors), and was responsible for using CAX software to design, draw and
analyze different auto components, e.g. transmission components. Besides al=
l
the engineering work, I also assisted my fellow members in the marketing
department to conduct market analysis and to come up with marketing
strategies, with the aim of gaining more insights into the business world
and the industry itself. The project went well and we managed to give a
successful presentation of the whole idea. Furthermore, in my senior year,
my broadened interest in Electrical Engineering led me to finish a more
electronic-wise graduation project, designing a simulation device for the
testing of the Battery Management System of vehicles. The project involved
design and simulation of the schematic, drawing the PCB, and debugging the
circuit board after it was made. With that challenging experience I decided
to devote myself for further study in Electrical Engineering, a choice
inherently corresponded to my adventurous nature.


Arup appeals to me because the diversity and pace of learning it can offer
is truly unique, with exposure to a wide range of industries and clients. I
am looking for an environment where I can constantly learn new things,
maximize my potential, and have fun as well. More importantly, there's a
part of me that is extremely passionate about Acoustics, Acoustical
Engineering and Acoustic Ecology, such fields that explore the intricate
delicacy of the relationship between sound, environment and space. What
attracts me most is that, among the many multi-dimensional projects of Arup=
,
Acoustical Consulting is exactly one of the business areas of yours. I find
this a rare chance and Arup being the most suitable place for me to start a
career in this field.



I believe with my passion, I would fit well in Arup.



Sincerely,


Yuan Gao

Subject: MIREX2010
Hello all,

I'm trying to reproduce the result of the "MIREX 2010 Audio Tag Classification" with CAL500 dataset, following the instructions from the "README_2010.txt". There's some problems that confuse me.

First, in the readme file it says "assumes train.txt is a training list file (files and tags)...". My train.txt has the following pattern:

../../audio/CAL500/xxx1.mp3 tag1 tag2 tag3...
../../audio/CAL500/xxx2.mp3 tag2 tag4 tag6...
.
.
../../audio/CAL500/xxx500.mp3 tagxx tagxx...

is it the right way to construct this train.txt file?

Second, after training and prediction through kea, I got a stage1_affinities.txt file. However, after the "> ../../scripts/Ruby/threshold_binarization.rb train.txt stage1_affinities.txt > stage1_predictions.txt" step I only got a blank "stage1_predictions" file. Can anyone tell me what the problem is?

Best,
LA

wanna check out www.zdic.net, sometimes they lis=B1 pronunciation below,

Subject: Marsyas Audio Tag Classification problem
Hello all,

I've been using Marsyas to reproduce some audio tagging task, and the results were unsuccessful. Help is needed.

- System: MacOS 10.6.8
- Marsyas version: marsyas-0.4.4 from SourceForge.
- Compiling: compiled with MAD, LAME and SWIG, using ccmake.
- Training/testing data: the as-is CAL500 data set.
- Instructions: "MIREX 2010 Audio Tag Classification" from MIREX/README_2010.txt
- Reference: the "Improving automatic music tag annotation using stacked generalization of probabilistic SVM outputs" paper.

Initially I chose 10-fold cross-validation on CAL500. The training list files were in the MIREX 2010 form (http://www.music-ir.org/mirex/wiki/2010:Audio_Tag_Classification#Training_list_file) for totally 174 tags represented by "1" to "174".

Then "> bextract -ws 1024 -as 400 -sv -fe -bf ..." was used for feature extraction. A warning message

"collectionName = MARSYAS_EMPTY
[MRS_WARNING] MarSystem::getChildMarsystem(): Flux/flux not found!
[MRS_WARNING] MarSystem::linkControl - Error creating new link control: Accumulator/acc/Series/featureNetwork/Flux/flux/mrs_bool/resetis an invalid path
Downsampling factor = 1"

appeared every time, but I just ignored it, until I got 10 .arff files for my training lists and 10 .arff files for my testing lists. Then I used "kea" as in the readme file, except changing the unfound "-tc" with "-tw", to perform the first stage automatic tag annotation.

The problem was: I ran through the whole process three times, and in 10 folds there was always one fold in which the model was ill-trained, generating affinities files that have probabilities all on the order of e-14, and blank predictions files.

Then I switched to 2-fold cross-validation to see if the same problem happened again, and it did. For each trial, either one fold or both two folds would produce the problematic affinities files.

Then I suspected it was due to some short songs and the sparse tagging matrix of CAL500, so I removed 4 songs which last less than 10 seconds, keeping only the five most frequent tags for my training files, and re-ran the 2-fold cross-validation several times. However the same problem persisted, either one or both two folds failed.

Please help me if anyone who has experience with CAL500 and Marsyas knows what caused the problem. (was it because of the CAL500 data, or the way I performed the task, or else?)

Many thanks,

LA

Boss,

I've been searching for Haiku by R. H. Blyth (four volumes) in Alibris. The lowest price was 150 for hardcover, 1952 edition in "good" condition, and the highest price would go up to 675 for hardcover, 1950 first edition in "very good" condition. What do you think?

What about your performance in Shanghai next week? Is it open to the public?

Cheers,

Nguang, Gol

Subject: Re:

I've encountered a slight problem, that my checking account doesn't have enough balance left for the payment, and the bank won't activate any transfer from my savings account until Jul 5!~ So here's what I suggest:

My amazon account: quietboy.yuan@gmail.com
password: Ftbct8e7Ftbct8e7

After login, you can purchase all the things and pay with your own credit card info (you might have to use your own billing address). The shipping address is "4125 Kissena...." The reason I want you to use my account is that it can conduct the two-day delivery for free, and the two-day method usually indicates a same expected delivery day
as the one-day method. If you're not assured, you can choose the one-day method also.

Sorry for the unpleasant trouble@@@

GY,

Hey, no problem. Gmail sometimes does too good a job censoring spams.I felt

Westminster is a good choice, and London, can never be praised enough. Your
family must be so proud of you. You go for grad school or undergrad
exchange? Since your interest is in art and design I would definitely not
recommend New York, for the art scene here is about 30 years lagging behing
Europe or Japan, seriously.

San Francisco is the best second choice, again I have no idea about how's
the teaching quality in each particular school, concerning art and design,
(I think UC Berkeley would be good, too?) I just love the city. New York, o=
n
the contrary, is a much overhyped city for me, never feeling bonded with it=
,
although I also have a friend who's been living in SF for ten years having =
a
strong affection for New York and couldn't wait to move here. Fate jokes on
everyone...

Here's a treat: http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/artaccess/ just discovered
this website, has numerous cultural and art journals for free download, and
only lasts till the end of the month! (but the server is kind of down for
the moment, maybe it'll get back soon, hopefully within today...)

Best of luck!

Two questions:

1, I know how to tell original German ECM prints from American prints, but
is there also any difference between the German prints?

2, for the Paradigm Reference V20, the speakers each have four connectors o=
n
the back(two blue, two red), should I connect them all to the amp? Because
now I only use one pair for each of the speakers, connected to the System A
slots of the amp, and they work, so...

Oh, something about the price. I went to Academy LP today (their 12th st
shop, not the headquarter), and was quite taken aback by the price. For som=
e
semi-rare recordings like Hogiuta by T. Hino or the Rainbow Goblins bhe price can easily go to 30 =
bucks, unacceptable!! I got one Michal
Urbaniak's Live Recording(Polish Jazz series) for 15, the sleeve of which i=
s
quite used but disc in fair condition... Are these normal prices for such
recordings?

ok 

for an easy downloading of all the links shown in the webpage:
http://avaxhome.ws/video/genre/Melodrama_Romance/One_Day_2011_1080.html

you'll see "Download: Filesonic, Wupload..." in the bottom. filesonic is ok. click that little "+" icon and the links will unfold.

now, you'll like to download a "downloading tool" first, it's called JDownloader:
http://jdownloader.org/download/index

after you've downloaded and installed the JDownloader, open it;

select the 19 links on the webpage (from part01 to part19.rar) and copy them all;

click the "Linkgrabber" button in the JDownloader, you should see that the 19 links are displayed in the window. click the start button (the triangle) on the upper left, and you are all set. the software will automatically queue and download all the files for you (except that you might have to key in the Captcha for every file, so be aware once the icon of the software prompts you.)

if any doubt, just ask me anytime.

Hello Professor,

This is Yuan Gao, yg2259. I checked ssol today and my grade for the Linear
System class hasn't been posted yet. Recently I've been searching for summe=
r
internship, and most of the companies require that I offer my transcript. I=
s
it possible that my grade be updated during the next week?

Best regards,

Dear Professor,

This is Yuan Gao, currently a second-year graduate student in Electrical
Engineering, Columbia University. It has been a while since I took your
Linear Systems class last year. I hope everything is going well with you.

I take the venture to write to you because I'm at the moment of applying
for Ph.D. programs in several schools, and a few recommendation letters are
needed. If it's possible, I'm hoping that you can write one of them for me.

I'm asking for your help because, the programs I apply to are either in
EE/CS or Music Technology, in which statistical models, machine learning
and signal processing are heavily involved. Among all the classes I've
taken in Columbia, yours is one of the few that is related to these topics.
I understand that this could be inconvenient for you, and I'd appreciate
your consideration. Hope to hear from you soon.

Best regards,

Yuan Gao

Hello Professor,

Hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving! I'm writing to see if an email from
NYU, containing ID and password for submitting recommendation letter, has
been sent to you. If not, I think I need to contact them because the
application deadline for NYU is quite near (Dec. 1).

Best wishes,

Summary:

To make a piece of music "footage" immortal, only three factors are needed--=
-

a, one net-gen-unfriendly, obscure, ass-kicking rock ballad from the golden a=
ge;

b, some hyperkinetic super-talented actors with maximum musical skills;

c, some extraterrestrial creatures disguised as human lunatics (b and c actu=
ally refer to the same group of lifeforms).

Subject: quick question
DJ:

A friend wants to buy a turntable for makeshift use. I found this:

http://www.amazon.com/Technica-AT-LP60-Automatic-Driven-Turntable/dp/B002GYTPAE/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1337629239&sr=1-1

The specifications say it has a built-in "phono" pre-amp. Does that mean it can be connected to a pair of small speakers directly? (Like the Sony SS-B1000 speakers shown in the same page.)

Subject: Re: quick question
Yes, you're right...

This is another solution I can think of (again, for makeshift use):

http://www.amazon.com/Crosley-Revolution-Portable-Turntable-Color/dp/B004FJYUW6/ref=sr_1_54?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1337630755&sr=1-54

This one has a headphone jack, so I'm thinking about connecting it to my friend's iMac audio input, using the software LineIn to directly route the sound to iMac's built-in speakers?

Stanly:

The book is called "Antonin Artaud Collected Works", if you look it up in
the library system you'll know where it is.

This series of books has 4 volumes, and in it there's a script/screenplay
called "The Seashell and the Clergyman". That's the one I need.

Thanks!!!!!

.  Produced by Sam Brumbaugh, Special Events Consultant, and Bronwyn Keen=
an, Director of Special Events, the series takes its thematic cue from th=
e poetic fusion, chaotic riffing, explosive color and sublime assemblage =
that characterized Chamberlaiwork. The series title Divine Ri=
cochet is borrowed from a 1991 work by Chamberlain and features the artis=
signature use of wordplay.  A great lover of music, Chamberla=
in pushed boundaries as he explored abstraction, rhythm, harmony, and dis=
sonance, providing a vibrant context for contemporary musical experiments=
 in the Guggenheim rotunda.

> =46riday, April 13: Grouper and Julianna Barwick
> Grouper is the solo project of Portland based musician/artist Liz Harri=
s. Since the release of her recently acclaimed album A/A : Alien Observer=
 (2011), Grouper has scored the Sundance favorite The Perception of Movin=
g Targets, and has been working on projects with both Tiny Vipers and Nin=
ja Tune producer The Bug (Kevin Martin). Grouper's stately chorded songs =
have been described by Wire magazine aounding as if they'd be=
en made against a vast mountainside: voice and instruments-muted piano, s=
pider strummed guitar and growling drone steeped in reverb and delay=9D Grouper's site-specific Violet Replacement performance in the Guggenh=
eim rotunda will be naturally resonant and comprise long-form ambient pie=
ces that include tape loops, field recordings, Wurlitzer loops, and subme=
rged atmospherics mixed and processed live from an array of dictaphones a=
nd tape players.
> =20
> Brooklyn-based solo artist Julianna Barwick creates music which is at o=
nce orchestral, choral, and meditative, using her voice as an instrument =
to create soaring, capacious chants and mystical invocations. Barwick has=
 been compared to the likes of Philip Glass, Brian Eno, Panda Bear, Stars=
 Of The Lid, and Cocteau Twins. The musician builds multiple loops and la=
yers off a single refrain, and State magazine described her live performa=
nce as composed oordless songs with transporting power=9D where Barwictood alone but sang like a choir of angels.=E2Barwick will open for Grouper on April 13.

> =46riday, April 27: Cold Cave
> Heirs to the synthpop noir of New Order, Throbbing Gristle, Soft Cell, =
and Muslimgauze, Cold Cave are an experimental electronic pop group from =
Philadelphia and New York who make melodic synthscapes with driving beats=
. Celebrating the contradictory beauty of the human condition, Cold Cave =
acknowledges the dark roots of synthesizer music as well as its potential=
 for making electronic pop. The songs on their debut album Love Comes Clo=
se (2009) have an immediacy that belies thought-provoking titles like The=
 Laurels of Erotomania and The Trees Grew Emotions And Died. In this way =
they mark the transitional moment when synthesizer music went from a subv=
ersive device for sound collagists to a serious commercial force. Live, t=
hey are cerebral and savage, yet sweet and seductive.

> Nika Danilova, the woman behind Zola Jesus, brings her epic, iconoclast=
ic sounull of dark evocative beauto the Guggenheim =
rotunda, performing a first time collaboration between Nika and esteemed =
composer JG Thirwell. Thirwell has arranged original compositions penned =
by Danilova to be performed with the Mivos string quartet. Zola Jesus's c=
lassically trained voice is commanding, rich, and silky and her music dra=
ws from industrial, classical, electronic, and experimental rock influenc=
es. =46rom thumping ballads to electronic glitch, no sound goes unexplore=
d. Building on the success of her highly acclaimed album Conatus (2011), =
she has recently collaborated with David Lynch, M83, and Orbital. Zola Je=
sus's live performances have been calleear perfect rainy day =
musiby the Washington Post and onstage she has been described =
by the Independent ahe physical depiction of a dove, of delic=
ate deliverance paired with the strength of determination and purpose fix=
ated in her soundJG Thirwell has worked with Nick Cave, Red Ho=
t Chili Peppers, Bang On a Can, Sonic Youth, Nine Inch Nails, and Kronos =
Quartet, among others.

.  Produced by Sam Brumbaugh, Special Events Consultant, and Bronwyn Keen=
an, Director of Special Events, the series takes its thematic cue from th=
e poetic fusion, chaotic riffing, explosive color and sublime assemblage =
that characterized Chamberlaiwork. The series title Divine Ri=
cochet is borrowed from a 1991 work by Chamberlain and features the artis=
signature use of wordplay.  A great lover of music, Chamberla=
in pushed boundaries as he explored abstraction, rhythm, harmony, and dis=
sonance, providing a vibrant context for contemporary musical experiments=
 in the Guggenheim rotunda.

ris. Since the release of her recently acclaimed album A/A : Alien Observ=
er (2011), Grouper has scored the Sundance favorite The Perception of Mov=
ing Targets, and has been working on projects with both Tiny Vipers and N=
inja Tune producer The Bug (Kevin Martin). Grouper's stately chorded song=
s have been described by Wire magazine aounding as if they'd =
been made against a vast mountainside: voice and instruments-muted piano,=
 spider strummed guitar and growling drone steeped in reverb and delay.=E2Grouper's site-specific Violet Replacement performance in the Gugg=
enheim rotunda will be naturally resonant and comprise long-form ambient =
pieces that include tape loops, field recordings, Wurlitzer loops, and su=
bmerged atmospherics mixed and processed live from an array of dictaphone=
s and tape players.
> > =20
> > Brooklyn-based solo artist Julianna Barwick creates music which is at=
 once orchestral, choral, and meditative, using her voice as an instrumen=
t to create soaring, capacious chants and mystical invocations. Barwick h=
as been compared to the likes of Philip Glass, Brian Eno, Panda Bear, Sta=
rs Of The Lid, and Cocteau Twins. The musician builds multiple loops and =
layers off a single refrain, and State magazine described her live perfor=
mance as composed oordless songs with transporting power=9D where Barwictood alone but sang like a choir of angels.=E2Barwick will open for Grouper on April 13.

> > Heirs to the synthpop noir of New Order, Throbbing Gristle, Soft Cell=
, and Muslimgauze, Cold Cave are an experimental electronic pop group fro=
m Philadelphia and New York who make melodic synthscapes with driving bea=
ts. Celebrating the contradictory beauty of the human condition, Cold Cav=
e acknowledges the dark roots of synthesizer music as well as its potenti=
al for making electronic pop. The songs on their debut album Love Comes C=
lose (2009) have an immediacy that belies thought-provoking titles like T=
he Laurels of Erotomania and The Trees Grew Emotions And Died. In this wa=
y they mark the transitional moment when synthesizer music went from a su=
bversive device for sound collagists to a serious commercial force. Live,=
 they are cerebral and savage, yet sweet and seductive.

http://www.ionaudio.com/products/details/iptusb-limited-edition

I heard that portable record players like those made by Crosley can ruin your records, because Crosley uses ceramic cartridge instead of magnetic cartridge. But I don't know if this is the case in the above-linked turntable as well. Do you happen to know whether I should buy this one or not?

Slavok doesn't know the door number of his own apartment in L=
jubljana. "Doesn't matter," he tells the photographer, who wants to pop outs=
ide. "Come back in through the main door, and then just think in terms of po=
litically radical right; you turn from left to right, then at the end, right=
 again." But what's the number, in case he gets lost? "I think it's 20," =C5k suggests. "But who knows? Let's double check." So off he pads d=
own the hallway, opens his door and has a look.
Waving the photographer off, he points in the distance across the Slovenian c=
apital. "Over there, that's a kind of counter-culture establishmen they hate me, I hate them. This is the type of leftists that I hate. Radica=
l leftists whose fathers are all very rich." Most of the other buildings, he=
 adds, are government ministries. "I hate it." Now he's back in the living r=
oom, a clinically tidy little sliver of functional space lacking any discern=
ible aesthetic, the only concessions being a poster for the video game Call O=
f Duty: Black Ops, and a print of Joseph Stalink pours Coke Z=
ero into plastic McDonald's cups decorated in Disney merchandising, but when=
 he opens a kitchen cupboard I see that it's full of clothes.

"I live as a madman!" he exclaims, and leads me on a tour of the apartment t=
o demonstrate why his kitchen cabinets contain only clothing. "You see, ther=
e's no room anywhere else!" And indeed, every other room is lined, floor to c=
eiling, with DVDs and books; volumes of his own 75 works, translated into in=
numerable languages, fill one room alone.

If you have read all ok's work, you are doing better than me=
. Born in 1949, the Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic grew up under T=
ito in the former Yugoslavia, where suspicions of dissidence consigned him t=
o academic backwaters. He came to western attention in 1989 with his first b=
ook written in English, The Sublime Object of Ideology, a re-reading ok's great hero Hegel through the perspective of another hero, the ps=
ychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. Since then there have been titles such as Living i=
n the End Times, along with filmThe Pervert's Guide To Cinema =E2and more articles than I can count.
By the standards of cultural theoryk sits at the more access=
ible end of the spectrubut to give you an idea of where that sti=
ll leaves him, here's a typical quote from a book callek: A G=
uide for the Perplexed, intended to render him more comprehensible:k finds the place for Lacan in Hegel by seeing the Real as the correl=
ate of the self-division and self-doubling within phenomena."
At the risk of upsettink's fanatical global following, I wou=
ld say that a lot of his work is impenetrable. But he writes with exhilarati=
ng ambition and his central thesis offers a perspective even his critics wou=
ld have to concede is thought-provoking. In essence, he argues that nothing i=
s ever what it appears, and contradiction is encoded in almost everything. M=
ost of what we think of as radical or subversivor even simply et=
hicadoesn't actually change anything.

"Like when you buy an organic apple, you're doing it for ideological reasons=
, it makes you feel good: 'I'm doing something for Mother Earth,' and so on.=
 But in what sense are we engaged? It's a false engagement. Paradoxically, w=
e do these things to avoid really doing things. It makes you feel good. You r=
ecycle, you sena month to some Somali orphan, and you did your dut=
y." But really, we've been tricked into operating safety valves that allow t=
he status quo to survive unchallenged? "Yes, exactly." The obsession of west=
ern liberals with identity politics only distracts from class struggle, and w=
hilk doesn't defend any version of communism ever seen in pr=
actice, he remains what he calls a "complicated Marxist" with revolutionary i=
deals.

To his critics, as one memorably put it, he is the Borat of philosophy, chur=
ning out ever more outrageous statements for scandalous effect. "The problem=
 with Hitler was that he was not violent enough," for example, or "I am not h=
uman. I am a monster." Some dismiss him as a silly controversialist; others f=
ear him as an agitator for neo-Marxist totalitarianism. But since the financ=
ial crisis he has been elevated to the status of a global-recession celebrit=
y, drawing crowds of adoring followers who revere him as an intellectual gen=
ius. His popularity is just the sort of paradok delights in b=
ecause if it were down to him, he says, he would rather not talk to anyone.
You wouldn't guess so from the energetic flurry of good manners with which h=
e welcomes us, but he's quick to clarify that his attentiveness is just camo=
uflage for misanthropy. "For me, the idea of hell is the American type of pa=
rties. Or, when they ask me to give a talk, and they say something like, 'Af=
ter the talk there will just be a small receptionI know this is h=
ell. This means all the frustrated idiots, who are not able to ask you a que=
stion at the end of the talk, come to you and, usually, they start: 'Profess=
ok, I know you must be tired, bu' Well, fuck you.=
 If you know that I am tired, why are you asking me? I'm really more and mor=
e becoming Stalinist. Liberals always say about totalitarians that they like=
 humanity, as such, but they have no empathy for concrete people, no? OK, th=
at fits me perfectly. Humanity? Yes, it's Osome great talks, som=
e great arts. Concrete people? No, 99% are boring idiots."

Most of all, he can't stand students. "Absolutely. I was shocked, for exampl=
e, once, a student approached me in the US, when I was still teaching a clas=
which I will never do agaiand he told me: 'You know,=
 professor, it interested me what you were saying yesterday, and I thought, I=
 don't know what my paper should be about. Could you please give me some mor=
e thoughts and then maybe some idea will pop up.' Fuck him! Who I am to do t=
hatk has had to quit most of his teaching posts in Europe and Ame=
rica, to get away from these intolerable students. "I especially hate when t=
hey come to me with personal problems. My standard line is: 'Look at me, loo=
k at my tics, don't you see that I'm mad? How can you even think about askin=
g a mad man like me to help you in personal problems, no?'" You can see what=
 he means, fok cuts a fairly startling physical figur=93 like a grizzly bear, pawing wildly at his face, sniffing and snuffling a=
nd gesticulating between every syllable. "But it doesn't work! They still tr=
ust me. And I hate this becausthis is what I don't like about Am=
erican societI don't like this openness, like when you meet a gu=
y for the first time, and he's starting to tell you about his sex life. I ha=
te this, I hate this!"

I have to laugh at this, becausk brings up his sex life with=
in moments of our first meeting. On the way up in the lift he volunteers tha=
t a former girlfriend used to ask him for what he called "consensual rape". I=
 had imagined he would want to discuss his new book about Hegel, but what he=
 really seems keen to talk about is sex.
"Yeah, because I'm extremely romantic here. You know what is my fear? This p=
ostmodern, permissive, pragmatic etiquette towards sex. It's horrible. They c=
laim sex is healthy; it's good for the heart, for blood circulation, it rela=
xes you. They even go into how kissing is also good because it develops the m=
uscles herthis is horrible, my God!" He's appalled by the promis=
e of dating agencies to "outsource" the risk of romance. "It's no longer tha=
t absolute passion. I like this idea of sex as part of love, you know: 'I'm r=
eady to sell my mother into slavery just to fuck you for ever.' There is som=
ething nice, transcendent, about it. I remain incurably romantic."

I keep thinking I should try to intervene with a question, but he's off agai=
n. "I have strange limits. I am verOK, another detail, fuck it. I=
 was never able to deven if a woman wanted iannal se=
x." Annal sex? "Ah, anal sex. You know why not? Because I couldn't convince m=
yself that she really likes it. I always had this suspicion, what if she onl=
y pretends, to make herself more attractive to me? It's the same thing for f=
ellatio; I was never able to finish into the woman's mouth, because again, m=
y idea is, this is not exactly the most tasteful fluid. What if she's only p=
retending?"

He can count the number of women he has slept with on his hands, because he f=
inds the whole business so nerve-racking. "I cannot have one-night stands. I=
 envy people who can do it; it would be wonderful. I feel nice, let's go, ba=
ng-banyes! But for me, it's something so ridiculously intimate =E2like, my God, it's horrible to be naked in front of another person, y=
ou know? If the other one is evil with a remar'Ha ha, your stoma=
ch,' or whateveeverything can be ruined, you know?" Besides, he c=
an't sleep with anyone unless he believes they might stay together for ever.=
 "All my relationshipthis is why they are very fewer=
e damned from the perspective of eternity. What I mean with this clumsy term=
 is, maybe they will last."

Buk has been divorced three times. How has he coped with tha=
t? "Ah, now I will tell you. You know the young MarI don't ideal=
ise Marx, he was a nasty guy, personallbut he has a wonderful lo=
gic. He says: 'You don't simply dissolve marriage; divorce means that you re=
troactively establish that the love was not the true love.' When love goes a=
way, you retroactively establish that it wasn't even true love." Is that wha=
t he did? "Yes! I erase it totally. I don't only believe that I'm no longer i=
n love. I believe I never was."

As if to illustrate this, he glances at his watch; his 12-year-old son, who l=
ives nearby, will be arriving shortly. How is this going to work when he get=
s here? Don't worryk says, he's bound to be lato=
n account of the tardiness of his mother: "The bitch who claims to have been=
 my wife." But weren't they married? "Unfortunately, yesk has two sonthe other is in his 30but=
 never wanted to be a parent. "I will tell you the formula why I love my two=
 sons. This is my liberal, compassionate side. I cannot resist it, when I se=
e someone hurt, vulnerable and so on. So precisely when the son was not full=
y wanted, this made me want to love him even more."

By now I can see we're not going to get anywhere neak's new b=
ook about Hegel, Less Than Nothing: Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Mate=
rialism. Instead, he tells me about the holidays he takes with his young son=
. The last one was to the Burj Al Arab hotel, a grotesque temple to tacky os=
tentation in Dubai. "Why not? Why not? I like to do crazy things. But I did m=
y Marxist duty. I got friendly with the Pakistani taxi driver who showed to m=
e and my son reality. The whole structure of how the workers there live was e=
xplained, how it was controlled. My son was horrified." This summer they are=
 off to Singapore, to an artificial island with swimming pools built on top o=
f 50-storey skyscrapers. "So we can swim there and look down on the city: 'H=
a ha, fuck you.' That's what I like to dtotally crazy things." I=
t wasn't so much fun when his son was younger. "But now, we have a certain r=
hythm established. We sleep 'til one, then we go to breakfast, then we go to=
 the citno culture, just consumerism or some stupid things like t=
hithen we go back for dinner, then we go to a movie theatre, the=
n we play games 'til three in the morning."
I wonder what alk's earnest young followers will make of thi=
s, and worry they will be cross with me for not getting anything more seriou=
s out of him. But tk, Dubai tells us just as much about the w=
orld as a debate about the deficit, say, ever can. When his sweet-looking, p=
olite young son arrives, I try to steek on to the financial c=
risis, and to the role his admirers hope he will play in formulating a radic=
al response.

"I always emphasise: don't expect this from me. I don't think that the task o=
f a guy like me is to propose complete solutions. When people ask me what to=
 do with the economy, what the hell do I know? I think the task of people li=
ke me is not to provide answers but to ask the right questions." He's not ag=
ainst democracy, per se, he just thinks our democratic institutions are no l=
onger capable of controlling global capitalism. "Nice consensual incremental=
 reforms may work, possibly, at a local level." But localism belongs in the s=
ame category as organic apples, and recycling. "It's done to make you feel g=
ood. But the big question today is how to organise to act globally, at an im=
mense international level, without regressing to some authoritarian rule."

How will that happen? "I'm a pessimist in the sense that we are approaching d=
angerous times. But I'm an optimist for exactly the same reason. Pessimism m=
eans things are getting messy. Optimism means these are precisely the times w=
hen change is possible." And what are the chances that things won't change? "=
Ah, if this happens then we are slowly approaching a new apartheid authorita=
rian society. It will not bI must underline thithe o=
ld stupid authoritarianism. This will be a new form, still consumerist." The=
 whole world will look like Dubai? "Yes, and in Dubai, you know, the other s=
ide are literally slaves."

There is something inexplicably touching about alk's mischie=
vous bombast. I hadn't expected him to be so likable, but he really is hilar=
iously good company. I had hoped to find out if he was a genius or a lunaticbut I fear I leave none the wiser. I ask him how seriously he wou=
ld recommend we take him, and he says he would rather be feared than taken f=
or a clown. "Most people think I'm making jokes, exaggeratinbut n=
o, I'm not. It's not that. First I tell jokes, then I'm serious. No, the art=
 is to bring the serious message into the forum of jokes."

Two years ago his front teeth came out. "My son knows I have a good friend; n=
one of us is gay, just good friends. So when he saw me without teeth, he sai=
d: 'I know why.' My son! He was 10! You know what he told me? Think, associa=
te, in the dirtiest way." I think I can guess. "Yes! Sucking! He said my fri=
end complained that my teeth were in the wayk roars with la=
ughter, great gales of paternal pride.

"And you know what was tragicomic? After he told me this, he said: 'Father, d=
id I tell this joke well?'"

Hello Keith:

This is Yuan Gao, one of Alex Zeng's friends. I graduated from Columbia
University in Dec. 2011, as a Master in Electrical Engineering, and am
currently looking for career opportunities in the city.

Last time I heard from Alex that you're working for scivantage, so I've
decided to take the liberty to write to you. Do you happen to know if
there's any job vacancies in your company right now, either entry-level or
summer intern programming jobs? (I basically think of myself as a Java
developer.) If by any chance your company's hiring, I hope you can help to
refer my resume (attached) to the HR department, just to see if they're
interested in offering me an interview.

Thank you very much!

Best regards,

Yuan Gao

Subject: inquiry about visiting Macau
Dear Sir/Madam,

I have a very specific question regarding applying for Macau visa:

I'm a Chinese citizen (holding Chinese passport), currently working in the
US on US working visa. From September 1st to 4th I'll be on a business trip
to Macau representing my company, however not flying directly to Macau but
through Hong Kong instead. I went to the Chinese Embassy in New York a
couple days ago applying for permit/visa for entering Macau, but the staff
there told me they no longer process applications for Macau visas, and I
was advised to apply for permit on the spot when I'd be entering Macau.

Could you please verify for me if this information was true, namely I, a
Chinese citizen holding US working visa (and returning tickets to the US
through HK), can travel to Macau through Hong Kong and apply for permit to
stay for a total length of 4 days upon arrival at the Macau customs?

Best Regards,

Ko

US on US working visa. From September 1st to 4th I'll be on a business trip
to Macau representing my company, however not flying directly to Macau but
through Hong Kong instead. I went to the Chinese Embassy in New York a
couple days ago applying for permit/visa for entering Macau, but the staff
there told me they no longer process applications for Macau visas, and I
was advised to apply for permit on the spot when I'd be entering Macau.

Could you please verify for me if this information was true, namely I, a
Chinese citizen holding US working visa (and returning tickets to the US
through HK), can travel to Macau through Hong Kong and apply for permit to
stay for a total length of 4 days upon arrival at the Macau customs?

Best Regards,

Ko

It's for me and two other friends of mine, both NYU students. I have a part

Move in is May 1 or Jun 1. No pets.

Can you tell me the exact address of the apt? Thank you.

Hello,

I saw on craigslist that you have a living room for sublet near Columbia.

Questions:
1. Earliest move in date?
2. How many rooms/tenants in the apt? Are they all Columbia students?
3. When to move out?

Subject: Re: Congratulation!!!!
Hello Ruby,

Thanks for all your efforts! I have several simple questions I wish you
could help me with, after reading the offer letter:

!. Would the company help me file my H1B application as soon as the program
is starting in the year 2013? If yes, will this be formally written in the
contract, i.e. as a provision of the contract?

2. The salary per annum ranges from 60k to 65k. I just wanna know what
would make it 65k for me :P

3. Would there be any vacation once I start working for the client? The
reason I ask this is because I haven't been back to China for quite a long
time, and I hope I can take a short vacation for that purpose in year 2013.

4. If I were to work for a local client in Phoenix, what's the
accommodation the company offers like?

So far these are the questions that concern me most. Thanks for your time
and patience!

Best,

Yuan Gao

If The FBI Both Planned And Thwarted A Terrorist Attack, Who's The Hero?
Let's try to process all that. Our first reaction was a simple one: "Yea, we=

Hello,

I just bid on the <TORU TAKEMITSU SEIJI OZAWA NOVEMBER STEPS RCA RX-2355
Japanese pressing Vinyl LP> sold by your store from eBay, and paid in
haste, till I saw your claim that you couldn't ship it to US for $4...

I was frozen a bit, and thought I might still pay for the overhead.
However... I've decided I really can't accept the $18.5 shipping fee you
proposed on eBay... I know the fault is all mine, but now I think you might
have to cancel the transaction...

So sorry for all the inconvenience I've caused you.

Best regards,

K.Y.

Hello William,

The turnaround time should not be a problem. My greater concern would be,
can you provide clear transparent vinyl like the one in the attached pic,
and a transparent jacket to go with it? If so, what would their price be?
Please let me know.

Best,

Juan

Hello,

I called earlier today, my name is Juan, phone number is 656-688-8554.

I'm planning to release several titles in vinyl in the next few months. I'd
like to know how the manufacturing fee adds up.

Requirements are:
- clear plastic sleeve OR white paper sleeve
- clear & color vinyl disc
- normal weight

And, can I be scheduled to visit your office and factory within this week,
so I can get a clear image of how things work?

Best,

Juan

Hello Taylor,

Thanks for replying! I'm still in discussion with my partner to try to
generate a spec chart regarding every detail in concern, and how many
titles we are going to press at this stage. This is expected to be done
before Friday, so I wonder if we can set up an appointment for me to visit
your office this Friday so I may present you the details?

Subject: vinyl printing inquiry
Hello,

I'm planning to release several titles in vinyl in the next few months. I'd
like to know how the manufacturing fee adds up.

Requirements are:
- clear plastic sleeve OR white paper sleeve
- clear & color vinyl disc
- normal weight

And, can I be scheduled to visit your office and factory within this week,
so I can get a clear image of how things work?

Best,

Yuan Gao

Subject: Inquiring about OPT extension
Dear Ancy,

This is Yuan Gao, a friend of one of your recent clients named Yeniu Pan. I
have some questions regarding my Optional Practical Training, and Pan said
I should seek help from you.

Briefly, my situation is as follows: I graduated from Columbia University
on December 2011, with a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering. My OPT
status began on Feb 1st 2012, and would be valid till Jan 31st 2013. Right
now I'm still unemployed.

I'm aware that for STEM degree holders there's a 17-month OPT extension,
provided that the person is employed. So my question would be: Can you help
me in some way to get my OPT extension under the current situation? If yes,
I'd like to make an appointment with you.

BTW, Yeniu Pan wants me tell you that she has passed her visa interview.


Best regards,

Yuan Gao

Ancy,

Yes, I'd love to make an appointment now. What's the earliest time
available next week? And, may I know how much do you charge?

Thank you.

I have received the materials for visa from my company. Can I bring them to

Hello Ancy,

Lately I'm preparing to go back to school, applying for a program in NYU.
Since currently I'm holding H1B, if I'm admitted, I'll have to transfer my
H1B to F1. I'm hoping you can help me out with the visa transfer process.

But first of all, can you tell me, in general, how long the whole procedure
normally takes to transfer from H1B to F1, provided the applicant (me) is
living in the US?

Thank you.

Gao, Yuan

Hello Ancy,

Lately I'm preparing to go back to school, applying for a program in NYU.
Since currently I'm holding H1B, if I'm admitted, I'll have to transfer my
H1B to F1. I'm hoping you can help me out with the visa transfer process.

But first of all, can you tell me, in general, how long the whole procedure
normally takes to transfer from H1B to F1, provided the applicant (me) is
living in the US?

Thank you.

Gao, Yuan

Dear Sir/Madam:

I'm seeking the opportunity to be accepted in the Fall 2013 Tisch ITP
program. I understand that the deadline has passed, and no scholarship will
be given in this case. I just want to know that if I apply now, will there
still be chance that I get accepted?

Best regards,

Gao, Yuan

Hi Midori,

Thank you for your suggestion.

Yes, I'm an international student, but I obtained a Master's degree from
Columbia University on 2012, and I'm on working visa right now. Does that
help facilitate the visa process?

Can you tell me whether Tusch ITP has spring semester for 2014, or do I
have to wait till fall?

Best,

Gao, Yuan

Hi Midori,

Thanks for your effort. I've just learned about the fact that, if my
full-time job can be maintained while being enrolled in a full-time
program, one can study without changing the status from H1B to F1, which
happens to be my case here.

I'm thinking, is it possible for you to put me on a wait list for Fall
2013, and see if there will be any vacancy showing up later?

Best,

Yuan

(Sorry we've just arrived in NY from The Netherlands, we're not familiar

Hi Grace,

You said "proof of income" and "bank statements", do you need mine (the
applicant's) or my guarantor's? And can you be specific about what kinds of
bank statements? Thanks.

Thanks a lot. I'll send you the upload link in a few days. My plan is to
apply first, and make decision later if I got accepted. After all it's

DJ,

My personal statement is attached. It's four pages long because the
requirement is ~1000 words.

It's been drafted in two days, so pls ignore the many fallacies and
exaggerations. It merely serves the purpose of application and nothing more=
.

Hi DJ,

New apartment finally up and running. Time for our cd/vinyl release project?

And, what kind of cd case/shelf you're using? I'm looking for one with many
sections/compartments which has a perfect length of one cd sideways. Cds
are big headache right now.

Best,

Yes, the two vinyl factories in Brooklyn are the best choices. I'll go
visit them & take pictures, tho I believe the prices wouldn't make much
difference. Details could be at variance, so pls let me know the details
you have in mind, e.g. weight (one of them hasn't 180g), color, inner
sleeve etc.

Hey DJ,

I'm sorry I was away from home for the last few days, didn't even have time
to check my emails. Sorry.

The CD has just arrived during my absence. I've ripped the WAVE files and
uploaded it here:
https://mega.co.nz/#!hFcCRKzB!FSlI2BLSj4BssOj6b9XdhQtstT9AFKQvK1h-1Xdw8nk

If you prefer FLAC files, just let me know and I'll re-upload the files
immediately. And I'll ship the CD to you asap.

As for the vinyl factories, I'm planning to go visit them tmr.

I'll rip the flacs also bf mailing the CD, in case you need them during the
shipping.

Yeah yeah actually I was only aware of the NYPL vinyl sale in the
afternoon, lol, I might be forced to go there tmr and slip the vinyl
factories. (But don't worry, I will def. go on Mon.)

Besides I'm currently drafting an idea for an App, guess it'll be my main

DJ,

Brooklynphono has replied, said that they need some more specific details,
like how many records we'd like to pressed, what color vinyl we like etc,
before they can give an accurate fee. Visiting should be able to be
scheduled within this week. Do you think you can come up with a spec chart
regarding maybe our first release(s), according to their pricing chart?

Dear DJ,

Namaste.

As I gather, SAC SH is at present your top priority and a full load. A good
opportunity tho, as you put it, for us to make use of the resources at
hand, your fundings and the yet-to-be-exploited musical facilities
in-and-around New York at this side.

Pressing def. be done in US, and I'll research hard to see if Discmakers
measures up or if better options exist. This better be settled prior to the
selection of titles and post-production. (Since 5/6 titles are readily
available, this could be considered executed, plus the propective of
emerging materials to be added with the unfolding of SAC SH.)

Once the pressing biz and money in order, we can start working on the
promotional and distributional details in the mean time. Ideal scenario:
When the titles are freshly hatched they could be sent to the reassuring
hands of our distributing partners (physical & online stores) in no time,
with all the ads & peer reviews in place.

I also envision the yet-to-be-revived Chinese New Ear would
ideally function as an aggregated site of all these acts for sensational
effects (on steroids, as you planned), including follow-ups of the latest
releases/performances/exhibitions, and/or digestions of new theories and
publications regarding the making/consuming of sound art of all sorts in
China. Even newsletters for ppl to subscribe to~ (I can also take
charge of ancillary Twitter/Tumblr/Facebook IDs in comply with the
despicable Geist of SSN.)

That's the general annotations I can think of for the moment. Within this
week I'm still up to hunting for a new apt to share with GX. (Promise's
promise=85besides it lightens burden of rent.) After moved-in I will get in=
to
contact with the CD/LP pressing entities ASAP. I anticipate this be done
before July ends.

Let me know if anything missing.

My regards to you, your mom, and Ma Nan.

(lately I just introduce myself as "Juan", works pretty well.)

Dear Sir/Madam,

I have 5 titles to press, 500 copies each. My time is tight. A small amount
of each title (~10=9620) needs to be sent to China by air to meet the
deadline of an exhibition by Oct 10. <x-apple-data-detectors://7> The
remaining copies will be sent to New York. Please let me know if it's
possible for you to meet the deadline, then I'll send you the specs and ask
for a quote (I provide CD-ready master files).

Best,

Dear Sir/Madam,

I have 5 titles to press, 500 copies each. My time is tight. A small amount
of each title (~10=9620) needs to be sent to China by air to meet the
deadline of an exhibition by Oct 10. <x-apple-data-detectors://7> The

Subject: Re: Wedding speech. Need it before Sunday.
Yuanyuan is one of my best friends in this country. We immediately clicked
with each other the first time we met. I think it is callehe meant=
 to
b. John, please dobe jealous. ;-p


I remember that, a few years ago, when Yuanyuan had just started dating
John, they were both leading a somewhat unsettled life. Both unemployed at
the time, with little money at their disposal, yet being with each other
had provided them with such happiness. Yes, happiness is the key to an
indissoluble bond between lovers. However, a relationship always meet with
looming challenges that threaten to snatch that happiness away. Indeed, by
the time they moved in together, their relationship had been facing some
difficulties following their new life. But Yuanyuan was an excellent
problem solver. She faced up the problems with John, and by effective
communication they strived for and succeeded in reaching mutual
understanding, which had blessed their relationship with a promising future=
.


If you want to truly understand Yuanyuan, you need to really know her well.
She appears tough, and seems to be always in control of things. In fact,
what's inside of her is soft, sensitive, sometimes insecure,
and occasionally pessimistic. I think that's a big reason she chose John as
her life partner, that he would always give her comfort, appease her
insecurity, and the most important point being that he's the man who truly
knows and understands her.


Now, my lovely BFF is here, in her gorgeous wedding dress, with the man she
truly loves. After conquering all the troubles, hand in hand, they had
completed each other and arrived at this moment of perfectness.
Relationship is not only about love and passion, but also understanding,
compromising, and sacrificing, all of which had brought Yuanyuan and John
where they are today.


Congratulations my dear, your happiness has just started!

DJ,

I think we should hold up releasing vinyls till we find a better spot. The
deadline simply can't be met. Maybe we can still do the important ones like
Klone Concert in the future.

The Rite of Spring cd was shipped on Aug 24. Guess it'll turn up soon.

Hi Yuan,

Thanks for contacting us.  There would be 2 issues with your request.  The
first would be the turnaround time.  4 weeks would really not be possible
for us to turnaround a rush vinyl order. 5~6 weeks we could manage, but 4
weeks simply can't be done.  The next issue would be with the portion
shipped to China.  Every Chinese customer who has ordered vinyl from us has
had tremendous problems with Chinese customs and in most cases the
shipments were never delivered as Chinese customs requested extremely
import duties and in some cases the parcels were seized due to the audio
content not being allowed.  In other words, shipping to China is not
advisable. We could ship to Taiwan if you would have a way of picking up
the parcels, but that can be a hassle for you.

Our apologies for not being able to do much here.  If you have more time to
allow for a rush turnaround of 5~6 weeks and a US/Europe delivery address,
we could do something.

Kind regards
Martin

I understand. So here's the key problem: are you definitely gonna need hard
copies of those vinyls (if they're made) to display in the festival? If
not, we can still proceed with the production and stock all the goods in US.

I'll call Brooklynphono tomorrow, try to ask them for green light for our
project.
Tell them we just need a small amount ready ahead of the festival so that
me or GX can bring them back.
Their price for every 500 copies is some $2000 I think.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I have 5 titles to press, 500 copies each. My time is tight. A small amount
of each title (~10=9620) needs to be sent to China by air to meet the
deadline of an exhibition by Oct 10. <x-apple-data-detectors://7> The
remaining copies will be sent to New York. Please let me know if it's
possible for you to meet the deadline, then I'll send you the specs and ask

Subject: Re: Need opinion on monitor
Wow, thanks for saving me money on crappy monitors~ So I guess I'll just
stick to my paradigm studio at the moment.

Not much going on recently. At first I was gonna partake in Guo Xi's May
exhibition in China by co-authoring a book with him which is due to be
published along with the exhibition. But then I dropped out and he finished
the project alone towards a different direction.

Now I'm thinking of getting back to working with audio, which is why I
(thought I) needed equipment. There's still gonna be app writing in between
me and GX, but that has to held up till he's done with his exhibition.

What are you up to? Had a wonderful trip I bet?

I have 5 titles to press, 500 copies each. My time is tight. A small amount

Hello Michael,

Thanks for providing me with this great list of properties. I'd love to see
some of them. In fact I made an appointment with one of your colleagues in
Elliman whose name's Roni. After meeting with him I'll be in Williamsburg
so please allow me to contact you afterwards, maybe early afternoon.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I have 5 titles to press, 500 copies each. My time is tight. A small amount
of each title (~10=9620) needs to be sent to China by air to meet the
deadline of an exhibition by Oct 10. <x-apple-data-detectors://7> The
remaining copies will be sent to New York. Please let me know if it's
possible for you to meet the deadline, then I'll send you the specs and ask
for a quote (I provide CD-ready master files).

Best,

Hi,

I ordered one King Crimson - The Road to Red box set on Oct 6, specifically
for use in a project. But the project was subsequently cancelled, so the
(unopened) box set is of little use to me right now, that's why I'd like to
regretfully return this box set to your company.

The transaction number for my order was 2807889959. I've received the box
set, but the T-shirt has never arrived, so I'd like to have the tracking
number first to find out the whereabouts of it.

Thank you, and sorry for any inconvenience caused.

Y. Gao

Hi Chris,

Sounds cool. Here's my specs for each title, and I want a quote for the
whole job (including mailing to China):

- 500 copies

- clear translucent vinyl, regular weight

- clear plastic (transparent) jackets, with stickers (text)

- white labels (with black text)

Thanks a lot.

Yuan G.

Boss, need some comment from you, if you can take a quick look.

Also, should we proceed with the Discmakers for the CDs?

OK here we go
Jump on www.zenithrecords.org
Look under specials, chose, than you may as well look up Preparing your
masters
Also check the templates for your labels
All our records are 180 G plus
All our labels are full colour so black on white is fine, your call if you
want full colour at no extra cost
There is no such thing as clear vinyl
Translucent or natural is what you are talking about
Now be aware that Natural PVC tends to be noisy much more than coloured or
black vinyl This due to the absence of fillers as well as plasticisers in
the material
Clear jackets not an issue included in the price shown, skip the foldover
jackets than
I am a little confused about the stickers! you want them attache to the
outside of the clear sleeve? you nee to verify or send me a photo of what
you want but there is time for that
Hard to get a cost of shipping to China, Man it is a very big place, so you
best send me an address or post code to where you want them to go and how
many
Is it for one title 20 copies? or for 5 titles 100 copies?
Clarify please
Cheers
C

Right=85 well, there's only one plant right now that can do the job for us,
which is the one in Florida that uses their ancillary plant in Australia,
but then they use 180g only which is not a preferable choice. Let me see if
there's any other factories put there that hasn't replied yet.

Hello,

I have 5 titles to press, 500 copies each.

Specs:
- 12"
- Lacquer cutting (per side over 20 minutes)
- Plating per side (2 step)
- Labels printing: black and white (white labels w/ black text)
- No sleeves
- CLEAR plastic (transparent) jackets
- 140g CLEAR TRANSLUCENT vinyl
- Test pressing
- No shrink-wrap
- Stickers, text, on jacket

My time is pressing, has to be ready by mid Sep. Please give me the quotes,
including all setup charges (I provide CD-ready master files).

Thanks!

Hello John,

6-8 weeks should not be a problem. My greater concern would be, can you
provide clear transparent vinyl like the one in the attached pic, and a
transparent jacket to go with it? If so, what would their price be? Please
let me know.

Dear DJ,

Brooklynphono says they can do everything we want with the quote given,
within the next 6-8 weeks, except for the clear plastic jacket. Please let
me know your further decision.

EKS Manufacturing is not replying after they told me they couldn't
accomplish the job in mid Sep and after I asked about the earliest date.

We cannot provide clear plastic jackets, you would need to have them
shipped to us. We do have polybags but those are for going on the outside
of jackets.

Yes 6-8 weeks is tight. Give me your deadline of the LP's landing time, and
I'll call the other non-local plants tomorrow along with the deadline
requirement.

Got it. I'll contact the other plants tmr. $2000 each title indeed ain't
optimal. Let's make more comparisons before we land on any decisions.

Hi John,

I understand that the turnaround time is usually 6-8 weeks, and I'm
absolutely fine with this window for the majority of the goods if they were
to be pressed.

However, my situation demands that at least 1 or 2 copies for each title (5
titles in total) be done by Oct 10 (4 weeks from now) so I can bring them
back to China for an exhibition.

Is that possible for you to just prepare this small amount of reocrds for
me before the Oct deadline? And I can patiently wait for the remaining
quantity, be it 8 weeks or longer. Please let me know.

Best,

Juan

Subject: 
Chapter 1 ...

We live in a world consisting of the ubiquitous Other. In here, the Self's
existence is soly dependent on the Other, yet the former refuses to become
the latter. The Self is being formulated, yet incessantly negated by the
Other. What a perplexing but nonetheless enchanting mechanism! Experiencing
this world through the Other, the Self in turn becomes one of the Other to
refract what has been experienced...The so-called artist is an individual
who is constantly attempting to flee from the Other before his or her own
flesh vanishes, not, however, intending to embark on a search for the Self,
but, with a sense of justice, to shatter such a mechanism of the Other,
like a brilliant beam of light impaling through the heavy veil of mist,
revealing the truth in a flash...

In 2012, I fabricated a painter named Jia Siwen, then adopted his identity
to draw a few paintings. Later, I made a differnt group of works using my
own identity, including texts, posters, and mechanical installations,
serving as a counterpart to those paintings. Jia Siwen is a fictional
"avatar," very much like a newly created social media "account." Within
this framework, Jia Siwen is conceptually an independent subject, while
also being a form of existence of myself. If an individual identity can be
treated as a flat plane, then a fictitious identity is equivalent to
dragging up an "imaginary space" parallel to myself, within which all works
produced therefrom receive an interpretation.

Chapter 2 ...

The "body" here is a general construct, can be understood as a substance.
In a similar sense, the "faith" here does not lend itself to religion, but
to something metaphysical--ideology, concepts, and worldview, etc. Since
more appropriate terms are yet to be found as a replacement, "body" and
"faith" will be tentatively employed. Recently I begin to pay attention to
objects that carry special meanings. Those meanings are seemingly contained
within some invisible space inside the objects--like a flash drive wherein
some files of the .belief format are written. By similar construction, if
body is a vessel, then faith will be its filler. In this work I invented a
gesture. This gesture will allow people to turn their bodies into a medium
into which "faith" can be downloaded and subsequently infused into an
object.


Chapter 3 ...

This is the last work that takes fiction as its subject matter. During the
creation of Chapter 2, I developed a great interest in the concept of body.
This interest had driven me to draw a comparison between God, online
friends, and Jia Siwen, and discover their commonality of all being a form
of existence of "Logos," that is, they all existed prior to having a body.
Hence I tried to use the pair of "God" / "online friend" as material for my
work.

By having Mary conceive Jesus, God therefore possessed flesh. He is
"Logos." An online friend shares the same trait as God: Before an online
friend is met, he or she exists in a state of "Logos." It is not until such
a coming-together occasion that he or she acquires flesh. Such is the
sacred moment when Logos becomes Flesh. I sifted through the Internet to
find users with a God-related handle, then chatted with them to persuade
them to come to the exhibition, in order to complete an act of "Logos
becoms Flesh" in reality. I will prepare a banner printed with "Logos
becomes Flesh and dwell....)" (John 1:=
14), as well as a "Wel-become!"
met, to greet this online friend.

de%20towards%20Audience>
Yeah the Osaka audience was brutal. Lots of really loud obnoxious coughing,
2 amateur photography incidents, which earlier on in the concert Keith
handled very respectfully, but what really made the experience bad is when
an audience member asked Keith how a genius could so easily be distracted
as he walked off the stage to (I believe) get the Japanese announcer to
remind the audience about noise levels. Keith then asked the general area
of the question who spoke, and when the man refused to identify himself,
Keith responded: "I'd like to meet the genius who wouldn't be distracted,
I'm just a human being," as he walked toward the piano. He then sat down,
contemplated, and was about to begin playing when the man found his courage
and loudly declared: "Mr. Jarrett, it was I who spoke." Keith had had
enough and said "that&#39;s it I'm done" and walked off. There was a 15
minute delay as someone came out to find the man who disrupted the concert,
but he had already left shortly after Keith. Keith then came back and
played for another half hour, but during the last piece another truly
exceptional cough ruined a beautiful quiet passage and Keith then decided
he was done and left the stage and did not play any encores.

He did play two full sets, so I'm not sure why the Japanese audience
demanded their money back. Encores are meant to be a gift, they are not an
obligation.

It's not pleasant being deprived of the encores because of the actions of a
few individuals, but at the same time, Keith as an artist did exercise
incredible patience, which was eroded thoroughly over the course of the
concert. An audience is only the sum of its parts, so if that audience
doesn't add up to the energy Keith needs, I guess its a shame. I also can't
really fault Keith because it really does affect his performance as I have
seen. A perfect example of this is the two Tokyo concerts before and after
Osaka, which were masterpieces. The only disturbance in either concert came
at the beginning of the second set of last nights show as someone's program
fell and made a loud noise 3 notes into a piece, which stopped Keith, who
said "at least it happened at the beginning," or something like that, then
took the idea back up and played an incredible piece.

If Keith were to merely pander to the audience, would we be treated to
concerts like these? I don't think so. But, at the same time, it does suck
to suffer because of the action of a few individuals. But, the clic=
rings
true in this case: the greater the risk, the greater the reward.

I'm not available from Wed to Sat. Never mind if we can't see that one
tomorrow.
I'm currently looking for a 2 or 3 bedrooms around Williamsburg with a
maximum budget of 1.5mil, so it'd be helpful if you can show me more
tomorrow.
BTW, our previous appointment is at 11AM tomorrow not 5pm today right? :P

I have 5 titles to press, 500 copies each. My time is tight. A small amount
of each title (~10=9620) needs to be sent to China by air to meet the
deadline of an exhibition by Oct 10. <x-apple-data-detectors://7> The

Hi,

Gary I'm a big fan of your blog and your radio show. Your knowledge and your=
 attitude towards music is truly admirable. Please keep sharing with us your=
 wonderful collection!

I myself have been staying in New York for four years. I'd always want to be=
 able to find all the great music like you. Nowadays I'll buy/download Russi=
an and Arabic music online, but for other music like the ones covered in you=
r blog I have no means to obtain. My question is: Is there a list that you m=
ight have complied for yourself or others, of some/all of the bodegas in the=
 city that you'd frequent for music? Not being a native New Yorker has someh=
ow limited my geographic scope, so if you might help me with such informatio=

Wish you all the best!

about NN

The owner of this Website is Ye-Niu Pan, presented in the online world by
the name of NN, her designer ego. NN originated from Niu-Niu, the pet name
of her childhood, an intimate way of saying "little girl" in Chinese.
Having practiced Chinese ink painting from the age of six, NN later decided
it was her calling to become a designer because, in her (little-girlish)
world-changing scheme, a designer signifies a charismatic figure, one that
possessed a higher transformative power than a painter. After gaining her
Master's degree in Academy of Art University in San Francisco, NN embarked
on a journey to the Big Apple (with her beloved dog Lucky), determined to
make her presence felt in the designers' world.

In 2011, NN began her career as graphic designer at a small (small-scaled?)
design agency in New York City. There she actively engaged in works of
branding, packaging, print and web design. The time spent in the agency saw
her mature as a multifaceted designer, who had made vital contributions to
the team in developing a number of diverse brands.

Two years into her work at the agency, NN deemed it was time for new
opportunities. Starting from 2013, she worked as an in-house graphic
designer for a global architecture firm. Since then she has perfected her
skills in environmental graphic design, producing results that exceeded
everyone's expectation. She also collaborated with the marketing team on
various successful marketing collaterals.

In the meantime, she was appointed as art director by a start-up team in
the fashion industry, helping to make crucial decisions on their overall
brand look and Web interface design.

NN firmly holds the belief that design innovation can greatly improve
people's life. Carrying such a faith, NN never stops learning new design
techniques, and is constantly seeking inspirations from the inner and the
outside world, where smart ideas blossom into life-changing designs.

Subject: Re: Reapplying to ITP, NYU?
Hello Midori,

It's been a year. How are you? I don't know if you still remember me, but
we had a discussion about (re)applying for ITP for the Fall 2014 semester
last year.

Last year I've had some changes in my job, which had affected my decision
to reapply for ITP, however this year I feel it's time for me to try again,
and I'm ready to become a full-time student once I'm admitted.

There's a problem I need to discuss with you. Last year I still have a
valid TOEFL score and I had sent a paper copy to ITP. This year the score
has expired, although I do have a digital photocopy of it. I have earned a
master's degree before from Columbia, and I've worked for two years in US.
Is it possible that I could only submit my TOEFL score from 2011 as a
digital file, instead of having to take the exam again?

Best,

GY

Subject: Re: FW: Yuan Gao - Updates to Sale
Hello Michael,

There's bad news. About the deal. That's why I had to defer the talk with
attorney.

There's something I haven't been honest with you, about the occupation of
my father, who is actually a government official in China. That being said,
my decision of not disclosing this info was not because of the money is not
clean, but because I wanted to keep a restrained family profile whenever
possible.

I phoned my family this morning, asking money to be prepared and
transferred. However, I've learned that the money, currently in a third
country, in the hands of a third party, was not enough for purchasing the
property at hand. Worse, due to a recent constraint on banking policies in
China, which has created a huge problem and difficulty for esp. government
official to transfer money to anywhere outside of Mainland China, it's
almost impossible for my family to transfer more money to the
above-mentioned third party currently...

So without an escape plan, I find it inevitable to call the deal off. I'm
really really sorry, esp. for all your help and effort. I've tried
everything I can this morning, but there's really nothing I can do right
now...

Again, I apologize for all the trouble caused, and hope you'll understand
that I'm in really awkward position right now in the midst of all the
miscommunication and social turmoil in my country...

Yuan

Thank you very much. Sunday works pretty well. Unfortunately it won't be
able to fit in a car, so I think a van is necessary. (Its dimensions are
62'' x 83'' x 54'')

Hey,

It's a little bit unexpected, you taking a short break, but it's a good
idea esp. when it's still a nice summer here. My gf even says she doesn't
wanna work anymore today and asks me to marry her so that she can feed off
me...

I think I'll be back to looking for properties in maybe two months. Before
that I'm preparing with my roommate to develop a new app that could
potentially lead to a startup in the near future. Besides, I'm going to
Borgata tomorrow for this week's tournament, and probably the WSOP circuit
event in Foxwoods following that...

Let's keep in touch.

Hello Ari,

I saw this 2br

http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/fee/4562438941.html

I'm looking for a 2br with a budget of around $2000 in Astoria. Can you
send me some listings you have currently so we can make an appointment for
viewing?

Thank you.

Subject: This is Yuan (Niu-Niu's husband)
Hello Patricia,

Sorry for the confusion about Niu-Niu's medical plan. The medical plan, as
is offered by CHP along with NYU, works like this (in Niu-Niu's case, which
is identical to my case):

The whole plan costs around $2,100 per year, comprised of a fall/winter
period and a spring/summer period. The fall/winter period uses a one-time
payment of $840, which offers coverage from August of this year to January
of next year. The spring/summer period also uses a one-time payment of
around $1,300. Hence, although Niu-Niu's enrollment in my plan begins this
November, the price remains the same for her, had she enrolled in August.
In other words, although Niu-Niu has missed the first few months of the
fall/winter period, she still has to pay the full price in order to be
covered from November to the next January. That amounts to $840 / 3 months
(Nov, Dec, Jan) =3D $280 per month, for the remaining coverage of this peri=
od.

I hope this clarifies things a bit. Please let me know if there's any
questions.

Best regards.

Shopisodes is an online platform providing curated, shoppable contents for
Asian females. Stories with relatable characters, a.k.apisodes, are
updated weekly as a display of styling solutions, allowing customers to
click through the scenes and shop for the best what online retailing has to
offer. The brand identity drew its inspiration from the lette, which
was then transformed into the shape of a swan as an embodiment of the
concept oransformed into a new loo.

The website is fully interactive, its interface designed to lead users
through the stories while offering a quick shopping access to the product
page. Shopisodes, currently under testing, is expected to launch on mid
August, 2014.



MIPIM is a powerpoint presentation for a conference pitching the idea of
"Influence of Millennials on Commerical Development" to real estate
investors. The presentation is itself a cornucopia of data and information.
In association with the concept oillennials," I converted perti=

numbers into information graphics, creating so impressive a visual impact
that no showings of bare numbers can ever accomplish.

Hi David,

In case of the bank rejecting a 60-months mortgage, I just want you to know
that I can definitely increase my down payment, also a shortened period of
mortgage will do, say, 3 years, as long as the bank feels alright.

Best,

Subject: Re:
Hi Elizabeth,

I just spoke to David. He's a very nice guy, I'm confident he's a good
attorney as well, so that should settle the thing.

However, there's something about the contingencies you asked me about
before that I wanna discuss with you (and the owner). As you know, I've
offered to buy the condo at its listed price without much bargain. However,
as I suddenly realized, I might have to put in an additional amount of
money for the renovation of the condo. I might very possibly need to change
the floor completely; the closets don't seem to be how and where I want
them to be I might have them redone. Plus the bathrooms and repaint etc.
All in all, it could add up to a considerable cost for me.

So, please be assured that I'm still willing to purchase the condo and make
a one-time payment, yet considering the future expense, I am really hoping
that the owner can give me a discount on the price. Sorry for not bringing
this up earlier, but things went a little fast for me that I couldn't raise
this topic until now.

So, please allow me to re-offer a purchasing price at 1.2 mil. It's about a
7% discount that I think will accommodate all the renovation expense for me.

Please convey my message to the owner, and again I apologize for any
trouble on your side.

Best,

Yuan

Hi Karen,

Thank you, and Niu Niu, for helping me with my apt search.

My lease is expiring on Jul 31. I'd be starting my search now, hopefully
getting it done by the end of the month. I'm looking for a 2bed, preferably
in Astoria, LIC, or somewhere in Brooklyn, that is not too expensive and
convenient to get to Manhattan (because my roommate is an NYU student).
Please feel free to contact me when you come back. I'll keep you informed
of my progress.

Best,

GY

Subject: Visiting SF soon
DJ,

I'm on a short trip to San Francisco next Friday, staying for 3 or 4 days.
Apart from the various record stores and Moe's, I'd like to visit Rev. Heng
Sure, since I wasn't able to do so last time, hopefully to have an
inspiring conversation with him. Is it possible for me to just walk-in
during his non-busy hours, or do I have to make some sort of appointment
beforehand?

Haha, I don't post much about much anyways. I don't believe in
microblogging at all :) But Weibo feels more and more alienating right now.
I do have a question that, if we're really serious about in-depth,
personal, and sustainable writing, what services really are there to opt
for? Still blog, right?

Hi Michael,

As you might have guessed I've just got home in the morning, took a long
nap this afternoon due to exhaustion...

Yes, I'm very interested in seeing the:
One Northside Piers
http://modernspacesnyc.com/listings/sales/brooklyn/williamsburg/5085
North 11th
http://www.aptsandlofts.com/sales/214-north-11th-street-unit-2t-brooklyn-ny=
-11211--4
and North 10th http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/3298558

I think the best time for me would be on Monday (if it's even possible to
see all three places in one day!), coz I can definitely use a Sunday break
right now...

Best,

Yuan

Hey, thanks! I'll keep an eye on the 246 Withers St 1C, and the Greenpoint
one you just sent me. I'm very interested.

Please keep shooting me new listings, I'll call you before I head back to
New York. I'll be interested in anything near Brooklyn Heights as well.

Subject: Billing Issue
Hello,

I'm writing on behalf of my friend, Yeniu Pan, account number 954340, who
is currently not in the country.

My friend kept receiving billing statements from your billing office
showing that she had a pending balance of $40 due on Jul 8, which she had
definitely paid on Jun 5 with a transaction record on her bank account.
This repeating letter has been quite a nuisance to my friend, so please
inform your billing office of the payment, let them update the data more
frequently, and don't send any more letters to my friend.

Best,

Hi Bart,

Xi told me about you. It's true I'm planning to move out, but could you
tell me ~ how long you'd like to stay in NYC? I just called my landlord
today, and still waiting for their reply on when is the latest date I'd
have to move out. My guess is mid April, but still need to be confirmed by
them, no later than tomorrow I think. I'll let you know the date asap.

Subject: Inquiry about application for I-20
Dear Sir/Madam,

I'm an international student who has just been accepted to NYU for the Fall
2015 semester. I'm currently working on H1B visa in the States, and my
department requires me to transfer to F1 visa to study as full-time student.

My questions are:
1, If I'm to stay within US till Fall, what is the approx. deadline for my
application for I-20?
2, Should the application for I-20, or any subsequent event like change of
status, happen after I quit my current job? If not, what's the relevant
condition that would require me to terminate my contract with my company?

I'm looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Yuan Gao

Subject: Re: Inquiry about application for I-20
Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a new international student for the Fall semester in Tisch ITP. My id#
is N15764129. Here is my question:

I am currently working on H1B visa in the US, but am going to end my
contract with my company before the Fall semester begins. I have filed a
Form I-539 to USCIS for a Change of Status from H1B to F1 without leaving
the country, and they have received it on Apr. 28, 2015. However, after 3
months have passed I still haven't heard from USCIS. I'd want to know that,
in the worst-case scenario, is it possible for me to register as a
full-time student for the Fall semester, provided that my Change of Status
is still pending with USCIS by then? And also, what are the
implications/consequences if I were to terminate my H1B status with my
company before September, but hasn't received approval on Change of Status
by then?

Sincerely,

Yuan Gao

Subject: Inquiry about resubmitting materials for application
Dear sir/madam:

I have recently submitted my application for Tisch ITP 2015 in the online
application system. However I've found out that due to some filename
mistake I actually submitted an outdated version of my Personal Statement.
Since this is a crucial material regarding my application, I'm wondering if
it's possible for me to re-submit this material in any way? I hope it's not
too late.

When I was in the Electrical Engineering department of Columbia three years

studying and working by myself on algorithmic composition mainly with tools
like SuperCollider and Max/MSP. Also starting to work on genera=

(1) Yes, late March

(2) Yes

(3, 4 & 5) I have been living in New York and working on H1B visa. I filed

Subject: Re:
The Cub Club was designed for MGchildreprogram that=
 tailors for
children from age 0+ (?). I had created 2 cub characters of different
genders, one for boys, the other for girls. Instead of using the common
colors of Light Blue and Pink for boys and girls respectively, I chose Teal
Blue and Orange Red as the two primary colors, because on the one hand,
they work more harmoniously with the new MGM brand colors, on the other
hand, they bring a brighter, more cheerful feeling to kids and their
families.


The Baby Lion characters were fully hand-drawn, and could be registered by
MGM as their own trademark. The secondary colors were created for making
patterns and other collaterals, such as kidclub cards, baby bibs=
, and
pouches.


We have provided some options for pouches, as you can see here (...)

We had also designed 2 alternatives for each pouch chosen from here. (See
lasers)


[Bathroom amenities]

The overall design look for babbathroom amenities is by using
typography only. They look big (voluminous?) and bold, but also clean
(crisp?) and modern. We didwant to reuse the Lion patterns too
profusely, which had already been applied on many other deliverables. As
you can see, the typographic bathroom amenity bottles sit nicely in the
overall design look, if not creating a greater harmony.

Hi Anne,

Yes we went to see 365 Bridge yesterday. I liked the size of the apartment
very much, but also noticed that the rooms were a little gloomy due to lack
of sunlight/windows, esp. for the master bedroom. I know there must be a
tradeoff price-wise, but at this moment I think better
lighting/floor-to-ceiling/balcony etc. would be a huge plus for me.

Let me see if I can find some other listings online today, and maybe send
them to you so we can schedule a viewing?

Best,

Yuan

By the way, I just wanna make sure that the developer didn't/won't specify
the anticipated move in date in the contract, is that correct?

Hello,

In "Product Dimensions" it states "11.2 x 6.6 x 6.6 inches", however the
actual vase is by no means 11.2'' tall, more like < 6''.
The actual height of the vase is not suitable for my need.

Hi Paul,

My name is Yuan Gao, currently a first-year student in ITP. My wife is a
senior graphic designer who in recent years has been focusing on
restaunrent branding, and we have been working on several projects

Colin,

Thanks for sending me the sites that inspired you ! They are really good
indicators of what's desirable for your sites.

After reviewing it with my wife, we decided on a price of $20,000 USD for
the design and coding of 5 websites, with 5 revisions for each website.
This is calculated based on our freelancing rate, the estimated hours per
week, and the estimated total weeks we'd need to work on them.

I understand that this number exceeds what you expected, plus there's lower
offers out there. But please understand that lower cost leads to lower
quality design. My wife is a senior graphic designer and we live in New
York City, and this is actually a fair price for such jobs in New York
City, especially if you are familiar with what agencies like QNY Creative
charges...

Please let me know if you're still interested in hiring us for the task.

Best,

*Gol Nng, 2015*

AN EXCLUSIVE SNEAK PEEK.

For decades now, folks who share our spirit for challenging the status quo
have been attracted to MINI. So, to help introduce the entirely new MINI
Clubman, we sat down with some of our favorite trailblazing Motorers for
conversations about defying labels and defining your own path.
It's good stuff we couldn't wait to share. So we wanted to give you the
first chance to watch our ad for Sunday's Big Game. After checking out the
commercial, be sure to share the labels you defy with #DefyLabels.

Hi Jeremy,

I've received the records, but unfortunately I didn't get the Chu Ishikawa
- Tetsuo OST (12inch vinyl lp) I ordered, but something else I didn't order
instead. I'll send you a picture of the unexpected record later. Do you

> Akiyama found out that a beautiful "tone-stone" could be mined at
> Takamatsu. Akiyama then went to Takamatsu with Mitsuaki Sora, Nagare's
> assistant and CEO of the Okada Stone Industry. Akiyama later recalled the
> moment when he encountered the Sanukite stone, "I was deeply moved when I
> hit the natural stones of various sizes that had not been modified by
> artificial elements. Clear beautiful sounds with amazingly long sustain.
> Each stone had a different tone. Sharp and very powerful. To be honest, I
> never had thought that stones could have such a beautiful, strong and sha=
rp
> tone."
> From 1961, under the direction of the architect, Kunio Maekawa, Okada
> Stone had worked on a project to produce an exterior wall in stonemasonry
> style for the Japan Pavilion at the New York World Expo held in April 196=
4.
> To check its quality, a prototype was supposed to be displayed at a certa=
in
> space in Takamatsu city. This location became a project of collaborative
> work and was finally used as a ca. A collective formed by an archi=
tect
> Tadashi Yamamoto for construction design, Sora for facade and interior
> design, Akiyama for music and Junosuke Okuyama, an engineer of Sogetsu Ar=
t
> Center, for in-store sound design, worked on each assignment and the caf> "Shiro no Me (Eye of the castle)" was opened.
> Two huge stone speakers were installed on the left and right side of the
> entrance to the ca. These speakers were invented by Okuyama and pr=
oduced
> by Okada Stone. "Enjoy our speaker system that makes it possible to play
> music in the most musical quality. As only 'pure sound' will be projected=
,
> the sound is superb" was written on a flyer at the opening of the caf=C3=
=A9.
> This became possible because all vibration except for the paper speaker
> cone can be suppressed to the utmost limit by the weight of the stone.
> In Sogetsu Studio, Akiyama used the sound of stones as material and
> composed an ambient music piece called Shiro no Me; Music for Coffee Hous=
e
> No.1 for these speakers. This piece was assumed to be created by adding
> reverberation components to an improvisational performance with Sanukite
> and slowing down the playback to approximately one-half speed. This very
> primitive technique was chosen to take a full advantage of the beauty of
> Sanukite sound.
> About one year and a half later, for the Tokyo Olympics held in October
> 1964, two large dining halls called "Sakura" and "Fuji" were built in the
> male section of the Yoyogi Athletes' Village by architect Kiyonori
> Kikutake. It is said that while Akiyama composed an ambient music piece
> called "Music for eating" they decided to transport the stone speakers fr=
om
> the caShiro no Me" to the Fuji hall. Also in the front garden of=
 the
> Fuji hall, an ambient piece called Music for resting was played. Both
> pieces, which were in the similar composition style of Music for Coffee
> House, were recorded at Sogetsu Studio.
> In 1965, Akiyama argued, "the purpose of designed music is non other than
> promoting the composer's work, who designs music creatively, in a living
> environment. (omission) The composer would also have to participate in
> urban planning along with the architects and the artists. As we all know,

> Jim HAYNES, "Flammable Materials from Foreign Lands"
> ELEVATOR BATH
> "Flammable Materials from Foreign Lands" has been issued as a clear vinyl
> LP with gorgeous matte-finish jackets featuring artwork by Jim Haynes.
> Mastered by James Plotkin, it has been released in a limited edition of 3=
00
> copies.
> The new LP from Jim Haynes is a haunted and provocative endeavor,
> rust-covered and mysterious. It is the result of an immersive
> listening/recording process through which Haynes' singular techniques
> intersected with an unfamiliar, disquieting landscape...
> "The album was mostly composed, recorded, and sketched during an Estonian
> residency at MoKS for a program that was hosted by Simon Whetham and John
> Grzinich called Active Crossover. The goal of that program was to bring
> together various artists whose work pertained directly or indirectly to
> environmental recordings. When John asked me about what kinds of spaces I
> was interested in seeking out before I arrived, I mentioned that I would
> like to investigate sites that had a considerable amount of
> electro-magnetic disruption which I could capture on radio along with sit=
es
> of psychic distress.
> The Estonian landscape is pocked with abandoned buildings of considerable
> size and decay. Many of the excursions for Active Crossover engaged the
> large crumbling Soviet-era structures. Given that the electricity was off
> in many of these sites, I had to rely on shortwave to capture any
> electro-magnetic disruptions instead of any fluctuations from shitty wiri=
ng
> or weird Soviet power transformers... and the radio reception from that
> particular time and that particular place (i.e. southeastern Estonia) was
> eerie and unsettled. The crackle, drone, and noise is unlike that which i=
s
> heard in the United States, looming with a (possibly perceived) paranoia =
of
> the Russian state just a few kilometers away. That said, Estonia had
> experienced an encroachment from Russia as the Russian military
> kidnapped/extradited an Estonian intelligence officer who was on Estonian
> soil at the time not too far from where I was staying. Given the
> contemporary military actions of Russia reclaiming Crimea from Ukraine,
> this incident put many an Estonian on edge.
> The A-side to 'Flammable Materials' reflects this aestheticized paranoia
> through bursts of static, pulsed noise, and atonal sinews of sustained
> frequency. The B-side is wholly more introspective, cutting up an Estonia=
n
> radio broadcast into phonemes, disjointed phrases, and cryptic speech. Wh=
at
> few words that can be recognized from the Estonian pertain to the forces =
of
> globalization. From the context of someone who understands very little of
> the language, these snippets of a female voice clip like a surrealist
> collage or a Dada poem. Compositionally, I was thinking very much of Robe=

> Jim HAYNES, "Throttle & Calibration"
> HELEN SCARSDALE
> In 2015, Jim Haynes accepted a residency at MoKS in the village of Mooste=
,
> Estonia to collaborate and contribute to Simon Whetham's Active Crossover
> series. For this particular incarnation of Active Crossover, well over a
> dozen international artists were invited to this region of Estonia to
> collect field recordings and engage in a cross-pollination of ideas,
> strategies, and concepts that spawned from those recordings. The refuse
> from Soviet-era industrial farming complexes, the droned blur of aeolian
> harps, massive oil tanks,
> and the torrent of noise from the Arctic wind ripping through an empty
> water tower -- these were some of the sites that this chapter of Active
> Crossover archived, with each participant encouraged to trawl through the
> archives in use of composition, performance, installation, etc.
> Throttle & Calibration is the first in a series of albums that find Hayne=
s
> digging through the Active Crossover archive and grotesquely exaggerating
> the details into exploded compositions of volatile dynamics, nerve-expose=
d
> dissonance, caustic shortwave signal abuse, and a considerable amount of
> scarred metal. Marked as one of the more discordant works to date in
> Haynes' career, Throttle
> & Calibration finds company near the atonal, muscular compositions from
> Hermann Nitsch and the sour, industrial collages that pock the Nurse With
> Wound catalogue.
> Previously released digitally on Cica, Throttle & Calibration is
> fleshed out with an additional 20 minutes of material. Haynes is a Bay Ar=
ea
> artist, conducting research into the corrosion of sound, photography, and
> video. Previous recordings have been published by Editions Mego, Ghostly
> International, Intransitive, Hooker Vision, Elevator Bath, and the Helen

> KRENG, "Selfed"
> DRONE RECORDS
> Starting with soundtracks for the Belgian theatre-company 'Abbatoir Ferm'
> in 2007, Pepijn Caudron aka Kreng has since then created an impressive
> catalogue of work, submerging deeply into a cinematic musical world, ofte=
n

> secrets of our culture, the roots of our collective fears and the hidden
> wounds, phantasies and rituals of our time" (as 'Abbatoir Fer' den=
otes
> their own programmation). Krengs compositions share a rare intensity and
> originality, immersing the listener into gloomy and surealistic
> atmospheres. "Selfed" is a work for a dance choreography by Kevin
> Trappeniers, a piece for a single dancer that relates to the phenomenon o=
f
> 'Self-Pollination' in Biology. "Selfed" is seen as a metaphor to overcome

> RELAY FOR DEATH, "Natural Incapacity"
> HELEN SCARSDALE
> Relay For Death are the twin sisters Rachal and Roxann Spikula, whose
> noise mantras transcribe the harsh realities of urban blight that
> complicate and threaten their own survival. It was in the context of two
> month medical study that the Spikulas composed their debut album in 2009,
> amplifying the emptiness of hospital rooms into a ghostly pall worthy of
> the classic works by Maurizio Bianchi.
> Natural Incapacity sprouts from a similar research and development,
> manifesting from the sonic pollution that proliferates in their current
> residence of Richmond, California. Clocking in at well over two hours,
> Natural Incapacity was composed as a seamless, glacial accretion of
> locomotive grind, subharmonic environmental rumble, nocturnal street
> sweeping, and the quavering hum of toxic chemicals perpetually leached in=
to
> the water table. By design, Natural Incapacity's oil-stained drone is
> completely relentless, implying neither beginning nor end to this cycle o=
f
> contamination. Relay For Death's industrial meditation recognizes
> abjection, horror, and defeat as the prevalent conditions to existence.
> Even as a declared rejection to those conditions, Natural Incapacity is
> engulfed in a bleak nihilism constantly churning back upon itself. Grizzl=
ed
> antecedents can be found in the apocalyptic works of Maurizio Bianchi,
> Kevin Drumm's Imperial Distortion, and Organum's Vacant Lights.
> While intended to be a seamless document, Natural Incapacity is split ove=

Selected Order Items:
    NETGEAR N300 Wi-Fi Range Extender, Essentials Edition (EX2700)
Comments:Hello,

I was returning this product and requested a UPS pickup. However UPS was
never able to pick up the item, only leaving me a customer receipt that
said Return Service 3 Attempts. Now I need to either obtain a new shipping
label, or request a new UPS pickup. Neither option can be completed on the
Amazon website. Please help me schedule a new UPS pickup if possible.

Hello Sam,

My name is Yuan Gao, a coming-up second year student of NYU ITP. I heard
from a fellow student that you're looking for a freelancer to help with a
prototype regarding RFID and Arduino, and I'm very interested in learning
more about it. My background was in Electrical Engineering before going to
ITP, and my portfolio website is: www.ko-yuen.com

Hi Sam,

I have experience with voice technology before, mainly on the software si=

Hi Sam,

Yes, I'm still very interested. So what you need me to do eventually is
produce a working prototype, on both the hardware & software side, and the
immediate task would be a prototyping proposal for the client, is that
correct? Am I expected to be working on the details by myself, or with a
team? Would it be you that I directly answer to?

Hi Yuan,

Yes, that is the ask. You would work with Tal and myself, but most of the
prototyping would be done by you. For now though, we need a proposal. Tal
has done some initial thinking he can share with you.

Sam,

May I ask how comprehensive does the proposal need to be? As for the
working prototype, does it need to be of production quality with customized
components, or could it be made/hacked from components/products
available on the market?

Subject: Re: freenlance work with RFID and Arduino
Hi Sam,

I did some research on the task for iOS, and the requirements for the pro=
totype seem very likely achievable. Most of the hardware components are r=
eadily available form vendors like Adafruit, though idefinite=
ly a challenging work to transmit audio data between BLE devices and iPho=
ne applications with all the processing overhead in the backend. I expect=
 it to take no less than 3 weeks for the final prototype.

As for Android development, I have to admit that I had very little experi=
ence (I do have experience with Java), and would have to follow a learn-b=
y-doing path, which will likely add an additional 1 to 2 weeks.

My fee would be based on an hourly rate X 40 hours/week. All works should=
 be documented in one way or another (Github, photos, videos, etc). Pleas=
e let me know what you think.


Yuan


On July 7, 2016 at 3:44:20 PM, Sam Joseph (sam.joseph=40analogfolk.com) w=
rote:

It doeshave to be comprehensive. We just need to feel good ab=
out to telling the client we can build it. The prototype can be hacked to=
gether
What do you think=3F


Here is some additional info:

What we need is a device, be it existing or custom that is
used to capture and relay sound to and from our
application.

So instead of a handsfree device that is used to make
phone calls, we need this device to relay sound data to our
application.

What we need from you is to find ways in which to achieve
this. We need you to either use an existing hands free device or
custom built component and create an application that can connect
to it and capture sound data, which will then need to be converted
into text.

The main functionality that needs to be achieved is
capturing sound wirelessly by our a custom built application
The tasks we need you to investigate, scope and produce
are:
A device that captures and relays sound (basically a
bluetooth hands free device - two way sound
connection)
An application that connects to the the device and
successfully captures that sounds and converts it into text
(Android has an API that handles natural language
processing)

A secondary element would be a way to open the application
automatically, be it using a bluetooth beacon, wireless button or
another approach that will activate our application and make it
ready for use.
I can then use the text data you capture within the
application and start creating the user interface, storage and geo
tagging.

Once the prototype has been scoped and created, we would
ideally need a scope for production.

useful they may be:

Hi Yuan
After our
previous conversations we have refined and solidified on an idea
and service offering we would like to explore and
prototype.

The idea

At its simplest, the idea is a device that is either worn
or embedded into something like an earbud (or pin) that transmits
and receives sound (via bluetooth/other tech) wirelessly to and
from an application installed on the user's device.

Requirements

The core functionality we require:

Capturing audio and relay audio back to the user via a
hardware device. Similar
to existing bluetooth handsfree device (which could be explored and
perhaps modified and implemented here), we need a piece of hardware
that can capture, transmit and receive audio wirelessly from a
custom application installed on a mobile device.
Triggering our application on the device using our audio
capturing hardware, either via a button or using an assigned
keyword. We need a
way to trigger, open and use our custom application installed on
the device in order to store and process all data received,
triggering appropriate commands and controls.
Record sound and convert to text. Our
application would need to be able to convert sound received from
our hardware device and convert it to text. This needs to be
explored, if possible use existing APor existing features on
Android or IOS.
Capture location each time a sound file is received and
logged.

The prototype

We are really looking to you to explore and offer us
hardware / software solutions, creating a working prototype that
provides us with an approach to achieve all the requirements and
solve any technical limitations that we may be faced
with.

We are completely open to any suggestions and are looking
to utilise your expertise to provide us with an effective
approach.

This can either be using bespoke components / technical
approach, or finding ways to utilise existing technology, AP,
devices or hardware to provide results in the most intuitive and
eloquent way.

Next
Steps

We need
to scope out what it would take to prototype so we can propose it
to the client. Do you feel comfortable doing that=3F How long would
it take you=3F What would be your fee=3F

Let us
know if you have any questions.

Thanks=21

Hi Sam,

I have experience with voice technology before, mainly on the software si=

Hi Yuan
We are assessing ideas over the next week with the plan to present techni=

The first is a voice recorder a cyclist could use while biking. While goi=

 you feel this direction is too limiting=3F

In addition, we would need to figure how we could build a sensor into a C=

this, it is only writing the tech requirements for now
Let me know what you think

Hi Tal,

Yes I think you can definitely use existing HFD like

 -
https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-Lightweight-Cancelling-Earphone=
s/dp/B01FVMM0JA/
 -
https://www.amazon.com/Plantronics-Explorer-Bluetooth-Headset-Packaging/dp/=
B00W3TAMG8/
 -
https://www.amazon.com/LAPOND-Invisible-Bluetooth-Hands-free-Smartphone/dp/=
B016DEP0LU/

Thanks for pointing in the right direction. I think once the device is
paired you can then establish an SCO link and use Cordova libraries like

 - https://github.com/macdonst/SpeechRecognitionPlugin

to do the speech-to-text. That's the simplified idea.

hi Eve,

in this specific case, use:

newText =3D file_object.read().strip().replace(', ' 'the trick is use strip() to remove whitespace characters from=
 both ends, then replace the occurrence of two spaces with one. for more co=
mplex pattern matching consider using the "re" module.

also don't forget to close the file objects when you're done (hence better =
use the "with open(...) as ..." syntax)

Hey List,

I have a text file and I want to turn it into a cvs. I was able to add comm=
as to it, but I just need to remove the empty cells in the .csv now

For example, line 1 starts like this:
[AS0] 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1.649 m.277 m=
.319 m
And after I run this python script:

file_object =3D open("trace_home.txt", "r")

newText =3D file_object.read().replace(' ', ',')

file =3D open("trace_home_2.txt", "w")

file.write(newText)

It looks like this:

,1,,[AS0],192.168.1.1,(192.168.1.1),,0.649,ms,,0.277,ms,,0.319,ms

But I need to remove the empty cells, where there are two commas in a row. =
And also remove any commas that begin a line, like the one before the 1.

Thx!

Eve

Eve,

the problem is with "if entry[0','", coz when the file object reac=
hes the EOF (end of file) there will be no [0] element for entry, hence the=
 IndexError.

depending on your intention, you can either do this:

if entry !=3D '': # make sure entry is not emptif entry[0','entry[0].replace(',', ''data.append(entry)

elsebreak

oh, actually, just one line away!

I wrote a comment where still getting an error, not sure why.

data =3D []

with open("trace_home_2.csv", 'rb') as fwhile Trueentry =3D f.readline().strip().replace(',,', ',=

Kuniharu AKIYAMA, "Tape works-Obscure tape music of Japan vol.6"
OMEGA POINT
Obscure tape music of Japan vol.6. "Kuniharu Akiyama (1929-1996) was
well-known as a music critic mainly modern and contemporary. However, his
carrier was not only in music field but also was very expanded avant-garde
art (especially he related early Fluxus movement). This issue is consisted
his three obscure tape music, sound sculpture "Environmental mechanical
orchestra" for exhibition, "Demonstration for opening event of Nissei
Theater" and unknown work "Music for H.Bomb".

William S. BURROUGHS, "Curse go back"
PARADIGM DISCS
William Burroughs was in and out of London from the mid-50s through to 1974
and for several years quite settled in a flat near Piccadilly. During this
latter time he developed and refined the techniques he used for creating
cut-ups on tape. Working closely with Ian Sommerville, who helped acquire,
and no doubt maintain, the various tape recorders that Burroughs used and
abused in these experimental works.
The work here is in 2 sections, which in their original form lasted for
over an hour and first appeared in 1998 under the name Electronic
Revolution as a free CD with Issue One of the French magazine Crash. The CD
was quickly withdrawn with maybe only 100 copies finding their way into
circulation.
This edition is edited down to 46 minutes and comprises the core of the
original recording. It employs the now familiar techniques of random
drop-ins and cut-ups of readings. The readings themselves also being
cut-ups of words on the page. The first section of the tape uses further
processing by means of a 2nd tape recorder.
Recorded in Duke Street circa 1968, the tape was then passed on to Brion
Gysin in Paris where it remained in his archive until 1998. This is the
first readily available edition of an hypnotic and meditative recording
that examines the hidden power of words. Closer to a work of sound poetry
than anything literary.
The album includes a 12"x12" insert with an essay by Ben Harper and several
previously unseen portrait photos of Burroughs, taken by Harriet Crowder in
her Hammersmith flat during a drug experiment. The back cover uses another
Crowder image - the very next frame after the famous shot that appeared on
the cover of the English Bookshop/ESP "Call Me Burroughs" LP.
Pressed at Optimal on transparent vinyl in a first numbered edition of 500.

John BUTCHER / Thomas LEHN / Matthew SHIPP, "Tangle"
FATAKA
"Shipp's manic repetitions, Butcher's scalar blankets, and Lehn's warm
reverb remind the listener of certain eras of experimental improvisation
and composition, but it isn't the remembrance that contains the power, but
the feeling that this is something fresh and new. It is a music that brings
up new ideas and paradigms" - Nate Wooley (liner notes)
"Free-improv, noise, call it what you will. Tangle is aptly-titled. This is
a dense, reflective piece that will take the listener some time to unpack.
To use an appropriate cliche, Fataka has captured lightning in a bottle
with this release." - Mike Borella, Avant Music News
John Butcher, saxophones, feedback. Thomas Lehn, analogue synthesizer.
Matthew Shipp, piano. Recorded live at Cafe Oto, London on 19 February 2014
by James Dunn. Mixed by John Butcher and Thomas Lehn. Mastered at Gray's

COMPILATION, DRONE-MIND / MIND-DRONE VOL.3
DRONE RECORDS
The new LP-series from Drone Records, dedicated to the Drones of the World,
and the Drones of our Minds. A kind of continuation of the Drone 7"-series
on a more user-friendly format. Each LP features four artists from the
international drone-scene and is limited to 500 copies, pressed on four
different vinyl-colours. Vol. 3: Jim Haynes (USA), Maninkari (France),
Kshatriy (Russia), Exit in grey (Russia). stunning artwork paintings by
British artist Pete Greening, design by Tilmann Benninghaus.
Jim Haynes: psychogeographical drones of rust and decay.
This highly interesting sound-artist from San Francisco (also active as
painter, label-manager, & writer) is focused on the unpredictable processes
of rust & decay in connection with the perception of time. For his
contribution "He stopped at a picture..." to the re-newed Drone Rec-series
he is using field recordings from a world war 2 era radar outpost (located
near the Golden Gate Bridge), combined with shortwave, motors, wire-tapping
microphones, analogue electric sounds.. =3D> a breathtaking experimental &
raw drone-collage, full of tension & almost dramatic suction, sound of
"psychic loss & american paranoia".
Exit in grey: timeless natural drones.
The main project of Russian Sergey [S] from the Moscow-area (who is also
active as Five Elements Music & Sister Loolomie) is mesmerizing the
listeners since years with small & handmade editions of emotional
daydream-drones, intuitively woven together with guitar, field recordings &
analog synths. The long piece "Drawn by Memory/The Wind 2012" is a perfect
example of his skills and creates with minimal instrumental & natural
sound-sources an atmosphere of timelessness and nostalgia..
Kshatriy: dark psychedelic (higher?) consciousness drones
Kshatriy means "warrior" in Sanskrit and expresses the artists believe in
the universal power of sound. Hailing from the fascinating St. Petersburg
scene in Russia comes this "fractal dark drone ambient" project, especially
focused on cosmic/transpersonal consciousness themes - these "Shifting
Waves" sound secretful & mysterious with a phantastic spatial sound-quality
(open to both digital & analogue sound sources) for the perfect cosmic
mind-movie.
Maninkari : handplayed / instrumental trance drones.
This French duo (consisting of two twin-brothers from Paris) has blown us
away with their captivating "handplayed" instrumental drone music, with
influences from various styles like Jazz, Art Rock and Classical Music,
combining improvisation and composition. Often based on percussion &
strings, they look at their sound as a spiritual tool causing a disorder of
the mind, a "visible" transformation of the uncontrollable dreams & their
own subsconscious. The two pieces "Enstase 1 & 2" sound at the same time
subtle, airy and dense using a suprising instrumentation, and show
impressively one of the possible new directions of drone music.
=3D four projects that differ considerably from each other, but united
through the idea of the power of the Drone.
The drones of their minds "materialized".
The "intelligence" of drones materialized.

Grant EVANS, "Brittle"
HELEN SCARSDALE
With a detached curiosity, Grant Evans drops us into his petri dish of mud,
bacteria, and fetid slop. At first, we have no roadmap to the drowning
noise that slowly trickles down the throat and presses against the ear
drums; but Evans is no sadist. Yes, volatile coagulations and
conflagrations abound with malaise at the beginning to each of the
side-long works to Brittle -- itself a vibrant landmark in the Evans'
rhizomatic back catalogue that slips through harsh wall noise, kosmische
explorations, dronologist collage, and the like. But upon the discharge of
that initial shard of tooth and blood, Evans tempers the atmospheric
pressures and illumines a path by which to proceed. Beacons of monochord
guitar. Radiant dispersions of glare and trill. Compacted bowed metal
resonance. Interstitial ecological sounds from water, bird, and tree.
Exhumed cassette minimalism. And a gasping, pulsing, morphing drone that
bends around each of these sound objects. Such is the vivid unfurling of
Brittle -- a meticulous and wondrous bricolage of the exploded organic.
Parallels to be found in Chalk, Organum, Toniutti, and Grzinich.
Grant Evans hails from the northeast corner of Georgia, from where he has
produced an impressive array of works under various aliases and in
collaboration with his wife Rachel. Together they had run the now defunct
Hooker Vision imprint, whose curatorial vision was unmatched in their
discovery of unknowable projects from the margins of the global cassette
underground. Currently, they maintain a smaller cottage industry Adversary,
solely dedicated to their own projects.

FOSSIL AEROSOL MINING PROJECT, "The day 1982 contaminated 1971"
HELEN SCARSDALE
An enigmatic cartel of urban spelunkers, ruinous sound ecologists and
earnest refuseniks, the Fossil Aerosol Mining Project began its collective
service in the 1986. Film, sound installation, and audio recordings have
all been part of their broader agenda, all of which falls under a wholly
unified aesthetic. Their's is a post-industrial model, sifting detritus
from the wastelands located in Midwestern rust-belt communities shuddering
in the downward spiral of economic demise. Upon the re-assembly of these
materials -- often culled from 35mm film and 1/4" magnetic tape found in
abandoned drive-in movie theatres and warehouses -- the Fossil Aerosol
Mining Project interweave with ready-mades of their own disintegration. At
this site of cultural and anthropological research, forgotten memes and
planned obsolesce begin to map previously hidden routes through the
psychological and existential landscape of the American psyche -- past,
present, and future.
Over the years, the Fossil Aerosol Mining Project has collaborated with
:zoviet*france: -- the semi-anonymous cabal of pseudo-ethnomusicologists
into our pre-apocalyptic past that could easily be seen as Fossil Aerosol's
British counterpart. With The Day 1982 Contaminated 1971, the Fossil
Aerosol Mining Project reconstitutes dissociated fragments from nearly-lost
genre films of the 1970s, filtered by scratched celluloid, bad splices,
dropouts, and damaged control tracks. Within piles of reversed tape loop
miasma and time-lag accumulation, Fossil Aerosol magnifies the grit, the
errors, the bad splices, and the dropouts within their mesmerizing and
hypnogogic studies of uncanny dislocations. Helen Scarsdale is honored and
flattered to be working with Fossil Aerosol for their first solo vinyl
release.

Toshi ICHIYANAGI, "Funakakushi" - Obscure Tape Music of Japan vol.17
OMEGA POINT
"Funakakushi" (1963). This electronic work was composed for opening
ceremony of hotel "Funakakushi-en" in Kagawa prefecture in 1963. It was
realized like sound installation used many speakers built-in stone
sculpture. They were designed by sculptor Mitsu-aki Sora (b. 1933) and were
arranged here and there at main garden of the hotel. The sound was made
from modified Japanese traditional instrument Biwa and sea wave sound.
Engineer Junosuke Okuyama [3] assisted for electronic devices.
"Life Music (tape version)" (1964). Life Music was composed as tape version
originally in 1964. After then, this work was played as another version
with electronic modified orchestra (contact microphones were put on al
instruments of the orchestra at Nissei Theatre in 1966. Junosuke Okuyama
designed special effect machine named Electronics Sound Breaker (=3DESB) fo=
r
the concert. Kuniharu Akiyama, music critic, wrote about this machine on
liner notes of "Orchestral Space" LP as follows, "...amplified sound of the
orchestra was sent to some effect machines and ESB, and they were driven by
tape version. Just then, electronic amplification was cut off synchronously
by silent parts of the tape, and only non-effect live sound was played..."

Toschi ICHIYANAGI, "Shikisokuzekuu-Kuusokuzeshiki - Obscure Tape Music of
Japan vol.20"
OMEGA POINT
"Shikisokuzekuu-Kuusokuzeshiki" (1964). "Extended Voices" (tape part,
stereo version - 1967).
The details of "Shikisokuzekuu-Kuusokuzeshiki" are unknown except it was
created at the NHK electronic music studio. According to Ichiyanagi, there
are various discussions for the title, but it seemed to be eventually
broadcasted on the radio with the title Kuu after a producer desired and
decided to name it. At this time, the original title was used as following
the initial intention of Ichiyanagi. In addition, short experimental film
"Shikisokuzekuu" (1974) produced by a filmmaker Toshio Matsumoto where
Ichiyanagi was also in charge of tape music was a different work so it does
not have any relation with this music work.
Note: Shikisokuzekuu-Kuusokuzeshiki means "Form is exactly emptiness.
Emptiness is exactly form."
"Extended Voices" can be enjoyed by listening to the Columbia LP album
"Extended Voices" with the collection of voices from the music works. A new
version with mixing voices of baritone of Takashi Matsudaira to a monaural
tape part was released by Omega Point in 2014, but since the stereo version
was found later, it was added as a tape work without voice this time. It
can be said that this is a completed work as an independent electronic
music. (Provider of the tape recording: Gregor Meyer)

Kazuya ISHIGAMI, "Hosshin no Kizashi"
OMEGA POINT
Experimental Music of Japan vol.5. However sound performer Kazuya Ishigami
studied at academy of music in Japan and France, he also acts as
noise/improvisation unit "Billy" and "Daruin" since 1997. This CD consists
of recent 2 works of "Acousmatic electronic music". I think many works of
this style are bored for electronic music fan because they are so academic
and confines in the style. But Ishigami's sound brought from his wide
activities and imaginations are so exiting and cool. - OP.
"Hosshin no Kizashi" is a work composed based on the theme "Pray" that the
priest of buddhist temple Senkoji (in Osaka) presented.
Hosshin: Meaning of "Departure bodhi mind". "Hosshin no Kizashi" is a
meaning of this side of "Departure bodhi mind" one step. That is, it means
there is still a hesitation. "Otokamui no Sasayaki" (Whisper of sound god);
"Oto" means "sound" in Japanese. "Kamui" means "god" in Ainu.
Profile of artist: Kazuya Ishigami. Born in 1972, in Osaka. Sound
performer, composer and sound engineer. He was graduated from Osaka
University Of Arts in 1994. He composed his pieces in INA-GRM in August

"Soundmatters is the first major compendium of the recordings from
French-Canadian sound artist Jean-Francois Laporte, including his highly
acclaimed composition Mantra. In balancing formal precision and intuitive
expressionism, Soundmatters results in a series of visceral compositions
that build upon the traditions of minimalism, graphical composition, and
phonography. Laporte reveals his colossal talents for experiential
composition through deftly processed recordings of tumultuous windstorms
that would make Chris Watson proud, spiralling drones that he's polished to
a Haflerian sheen, the majestic bellowing of sustained horns in the empty
cargo hull of a decommissioned ship, and of course the metallic growl of
his immaculate Mantra. Given the numerous parallels to Xenakis' smoldering
electroacoustics and Tony Conrad's delirious harmonics, Laporte's work
demands the attention as an under recognized genius in the realm of
avant-garde composition."ectro-Prana" (1998). "Boule qui roule..."

Robert MILLIS, "Relief"
HELEN SCARSDALE
Our man Millis is a Climax Golden Twin and a noted curator of globe
trotting / time traveling esoterica, amongst other accolades. In the former
category, Millis and Jeffery Taylor steadily release some of the most
headscratching amalgamations of avant-rock, decontextualized temple music,
heightened-state minimalism, and collaged field recordings this side of the
Sun City Girls (including the soundtrack to the cult film Session Nine);
and in the latter, Millis has published a number of acclaimed anthologies
for Sublime Frequencies (Scattered Melodies, This World is Unreal Like a
Snake in a Rope, Phi Ta Khon, The Crying Princess, etc.) and
Dust-To-Digital (our personal favorite, aptly titled Victrola Favorites).
With his fingers in so many jars of jam, it can seem like an uncommon
occurrence for Millis to release solo work although he is one to smear his
sticky hands all over himself in performance, installation, and
collaboration. Thus, The Helen Scarsdale Agency is delighted in presenting
his latest opus, Relief.
A fever dream of blurred harmonics and ethnomusicological spelunking,
Relief repeatedly returns to variations on a peculiar yet beautifully
serpentine drone, whose twinkling acoustic properties meld the
hallucinatory mouth-music of the Bangladeshi Murung people and the curved
air hypnosis of Terry Riley. Millis bookends and interrupts his mysterious
miasma with comedic interludes snatched from his lauded collection of
antique 78s, maudlin piano tone-clusters, and teleported crescendos of
spectral ballroom waltzes. More Nurse With Wound than The Caretaker, this
polyglot raga-drone of daytime somnambulism and psychedelic slipperiness
speaks to the uneasy borders at psychological, cultural, and geophysical
states of being. Oh, to be a human on this planet.

Hiroaki MINAMI, "Electronic symphony - Obscure Tape Music of Japan
vol.10
OMEGA POINT
Electronic Symphony No.1 (1977). "This unknown composer (not only for
foreign fans, but also for domestic) is a pioneer of synthesizer music in
Japan. However he was a professor of the top of academy of art university
in Japan 'Tokyo Geidai', actually he had a class of electronic music in
there firstly. Also he built a private studio for self-made synthesizer in
his home in 1976. This "Electronic Symphony No.1" is the earliest
composition of the series. The spacy and very noisy sounds of analog
synthesizer are like Roland Kayn's 60's concrete works." (label note). "At
the age of 15, having more of an interest in technology than music, I began
to build radio sets and vacuum tube amplifiers. In the next 20 years,
electronics advanced into the realm of transistors and integrated circuits
creating a huge potential for the use of the synthesizer for musical
applications. In the 70's as knowledge about experiments in transistors,
integrated circuit oscillators, and filter technology became available in
electronic technology magazines, I attempted IC even though I only had
vacuum tubes to completed an analog synthesizer, and purchased 2-channel
and 4-channel tape recorders. I was finally equipped with the necessary
equipment to create electronic music when tragedy struck my family: my
eight-year-old daughter died from liver disease. It compelled me to compose
the fifth movement "Sorrow Song the Stars Sang" of the Electronic Symphony
No.1 as the requiem for my daughter. The piece, created from my own analog
synthesizer, was distributed throughout the world as an individual work,
and only later did I compose the rest of the movements in order to complete
Symphony No. 1." Hiroaki Minami.

Hiroaki MINAMI, "Kumo no ito" - Obscure Tape Music of Japan vol.19
OMEGA POINT
"Kumo no Ito (The Spider's Thread)" (1977). In 1977. I started the project
of a musical piece for a female narrator and 4-channel electronic sounds
with the text of the well-known Akutagawa novel. I worked with the
hand-made analogue synthesizer which had been installed two years before in
my home studio in Tokyo. Needless to say, the editing task was proceeded
without the digital machines. I worked with the recorded tapes together
with the scissors and the splicing tape. It was the resonance adding
apparatus that I operated the resonance which was very important as sound
effect. The part for the synthesizer was made manually ; recording the
short fragments and collecting them onto one tape through several tape
recorders. My studio was full of a lot of tape fragments. I think the
situation in those days was stupendous but I didn't feel distress. The
manual procedure was usual at that time, so I could rather enjoy the
process of advancing towards the goal step by step.
"Chaos" (1966-2012). In 1966 I composed a piece of concrete music titled
Taiyo-fu (Solar Wind). It was to be staged as a performance of Tokyo-based
Mieko Fuji Dance Company. The dance performance participated in the
National Arts Festival of Agency for Cultural Affairs. The stage concept
was to create a new modern dance, which suggest that the sun would be
perpetually pouring all the energy of light, heat and wind to the earth. I
made the music by manipulating the materials of the recorded instrumental
sounds, not of the concrete sounds. With the idea of applying the editing
and modifying methods of concrete music to the recorded instrumental
sounds, I had started with composing a lot of fragments, and then I played
them and recorded in our recording studio. Some students of Tokyo College
of Music, where I worked as a teacher, helped me as musical performers. The
recorded sound materials were operated in my private studio. Manipulating
several tape recorders, I tried to produce the sounds that could not be
identified as the original instruments. Thus I created out the seventy
minute stage music. Fifty years have passed and the digital technology is
now easy to access. But I remember the process of my manual operation and I
can't wipe the commitment to the music of Taiyo-fu. Nevertheless, I think
the music is too monotonous to be appreciated without dance. So I
re-constructed a piece with the sound materials of Taiyo-fu. The basic idea
concerns the cosmic world and the title of the piece is Chaos. This Chaos
comes from my illusion about the primordial universe.

Makoto MOROI, "Kusabira" - Obscure Tape Music of Japan vol.13
OMEGA POINT
Obscure tape music of japan vol.13. One of pioneers of japanese electronic
music makoto moroi composed "kusabira" for kyogen (traditional comical
theater) with electronic sound in 1964. 'kusabira' means mushroom. a
strolling buddhist monk 'yamabushi' tried to exterminate many mushrooms
grew out in garden of a man's home. however and his magic did not take
effect for them but also the mushrooms began to increase. the man and
yamabushi were driven out of home by large mushroom finally. in this work
and moroi modulated kyogen lines into concrete sound. it's so noisy and
strange! This cd also includes moroi's important work used japanese
traditional instruments. the thought of this work was based on alvin
toffler's "future shock" and was composed as spacephonic music by 4-channel
recording system for great player susumu miyashita. he played various kinds
of koto, gongs and percussions and indian flute bansuries. sharpness of the
performance is so wonderful and also some human voices transformed noise
sound are inserted on middle part of this work. both works are most
avant-garde of moroi's works!!

MURMER, "What Are The Roots That Clutch"
HELEN SCARSDALE
"It was a cavernous tone that broadcast from a ventilator duct that
inspired Patrick McGinley to begin collecting field recordings and working
them into his slow-arc compositions. At the time when he heard that
particular tone in that particular city at that particular time, he had no
gear to recording device on hand. Over the next fifteen years (and
counting) McGinley has eased into a peripatetic lifestyle, wandering the
European countryside and forests (but never straying too far from the thrum
and spark of civilization) in search of the same epiphany with his head
rattled to the sound of a cavernous air duct. Around 1996, McGinley adopted
the moniker Murmer for his compositional work; and though his work often
steps into the quieter realm of sound construction, much of his field
recordings and resultant compositions privilege interference and
disturbances that occur within any given sound ecology. Those sounds could
be the elusive tone from that ventilator, the polyrhythmic chorus of
chirping frogs, the abstracted roar from an Arctic wind tearing across the
Black Sea, or the metallic skree from a bowed antenna perched atop a
Soviet-era observatory. What Are The Roots That Clutch marks McGinley's
first full album in nearly 5 years, but it marks an elegant continuation of
his previous album We Share A Shadow. The five chapters of this album can't
easily be associated with any specific location; instead McGinley overlaps
and crosshatches his field recordings and abstractions into acousmatic
passages with ghostly, half-melodic qualities. Even the two unprocessed
recordings of the album are impossibly complex in their accretions of
sound. McGinley's composed pieces embrace lithe, mysterious drones whose
mossy, damp atmosphere perfectly situate with tactile crunches, tactile
events, and signal noise generation. Eels and leaches would not be out of
place in such an environment; but the subaquatic murk snaps into a hallowed
manifestation of ritualized minimalism at the album's finale/ -- one that
LaMonte Young and Angus Maclise might have conjured in 1968 with clattering
percussive elements and a hypnotic blur of harmonic drone. What Are The
Roots That Clutch is limited to 400 copies and comes housed with
letterpress artwork."

OMIT, "Interceptor"
HELEN SCARSDALE
"Omit is the nom de plume for Clinton Williams, an electronic musician who
has been quietly toiling in New Zealand for a good portion of the past two
decades. His work has appeared alongside such luminaries of the NZ free
noise community as Birchville Cat Motel, The Dead C, Flies Inside The Sun,
Dean Roberts, Surface Of The Earth, etc.; however, Omit's home-spun
constructs widely detour from the sculpted grit and mottled distortion
found in the work of his countrymen and -women. In listening to his
masterful Quad (a 3CD opus released in 1998 through Corpus Hermeticum), one
gets the very palpable sense of an artist in a contentious argument with
his own unwieldy mousetrap of tape-loops, modular electronics, effects
pedals, drum machines, and the creaking sounds of his house. That internal
debate with himself through his machine exudes an existential melancholy,
which could be applied to any number of grander metaphors of the dependency
of electronics, cybernetics, and technology upon mankind. Interceptor is
the result of an experiment whereby Williams worked with a portable studio
away from his longtime home of Blenheim. He possessed two suitcases of drum
machines, effects, and analog synths; and, Williams recalls being "pissed
off with myself wasting time recording this stuff when I was trying to find
a job". His frustrations stripped away much of the grandiose sweeps of
ambience and shadow, leaving behind a life-support system grid of
overlapping, phase-shifted blip and click. An undertow of hypnotic
tonalities pulls those rhythms towards a crepuscular gloom. Williams has
always been at odds with his own work, yet his self-doubt continues to
deliver magnificent albums which thrive in a symbiotic struggle with
mechanical disintegration. Interceptor conjures the best offered by Mika
Vainio, Klaus Schulze, and the Throbbing Gristle tracks authored by Chris
Carter. Always the pessimist, Williams grumbles, "In many ways, it's a
document of my failure to do the most simplest things in life". If only all
of our failures could be this brilliant."

use of sound has made him part of a singular and changing landscape which

the shape of sound installations in which the sound device, one that is not

very narrative and sounds, offers each listener a plural and open

Somei SATOH, "Echoes" - Obscure Tape Music of Japan vol.18
OMEGA POINT
"Emerald Tablet" (1978) was recorded at the NHK electronic-music studio in
1978. It is made up of only the sonic ingredients of a tubular bell,
cymbals, and "Kin," a largish-sized bell used for Buddhist memorial
services in Japan. The attack of the sound of each instrument was
eliminated, and the work was taped through repeated overdubbing. This
produced a variety of beautiful harmonics that otherwise could not be
produced from a single instrument's sound, and the interference of
harmonics created beats, generating a fantastical melody in the high tone
range. Harmonics are one of the most mystic phenomena in the world. The
wonder of harmonics led me to produce Emerald Tablet.
"Echoes" (1981) was composed for the "Mist, Sound, and Light Festival," a
10-day event organized by the hot spring tourist association of Kawaji,
Tochigi Prefecture, that was held on May 20-29, 1981. The venue was located
at the Kawaji hot spring's Ojika river valley, which was 50 meters wide and
200 meters long with an area of 7,000 square meters. Eight large
loudspeakers were set up on hills surrounding the stream, with music played
through an octuple channel-tape system. The combined length of cables
connected with the loudspeakers exceeded one kilometers. The audience was
amidst dense artificial mists spreading upward from the bottom of the
valley, laser light beams projected on the hill surface, and tape music
that played in extremely low tone at full blast, echoing in the valley.
Echoes consists of the sonic ingredients of the three types of percussion
instruments used in Emerald Tablet as well as my own voice. - Somei Satoh
Somei Satoh. Born in Sendai, 1947, composer. He began teaching himself
western music and exploring experimental music at the age of eighteen.
Since the late 1960s, he has presented several multimedia works. He
subsequently spent a year in New York with an invitation from the Asian
Cultural Council. Satoh's works have been widely performed in USA, European
countries and many countries in the Pacific basin. His other electronic
works are Mandara, Mantra and Tantra.

Experimental Music of Japan vol.8. "Music Collage Re-Mix version"

"Sound Work 1" (1983), "Forest of Gombe" (2005), "Assemblage 2004" (2004),
"Meteora version 1.0" (2007). Assemblage is a word from domain of modern
art. This is the one of the technique of expression of art. The word means
mixture originally. I decide the assemblage as a concept of this CD. The
collage by Picasso is similar example. Dadaism is also similar example. I
try to express new direction of music by using assemblage technique.
Profile of artist : Kazuo Uehara was born in Osaka in 1949. He studied
composition in Tokyo and in New York. He is an Professor of Music at the
Osaka University of Arts. He gives courses on composition, experimental
music and also multi-media performance at the university. His music has
been performed in France, Germany, U.S.A., and other countries. He also
performed his interactive live music and multi-media pieces at major
festivals in Sweden, Bulgalia, Russia, France, Poland, Brasil, China, Korea

Kazuo UEHARA, "Event' 73" - Obscure Tape Music of Japan vol.15
OMEGA POINT
"From 1972 to 1973, I was based in New York for my creative activities and
live performances. New York at this time was in its golden age of
experimental music. Towards the end of my stay, I held a live performance
entitled Event '73 to sum up my creative works in New York. The venue for
the performance was The Kitchen of the Mercer Arts Center that provided
spaces for innovative and emerging artists. This CD consists of a mixture
of sounds that were created at a studio prior to the live performance and
the sounds recorded live at the performance. I used the Buckla Synthesizer
for electronic sound and also for transformation of the sound. The work has
four different segments: 1) Diffusion 2) Condensation 3) Chaos 4)
Revolution. Each segment's meanings and sounds itself doesn't necessarily
correlate to each other. Yet, the images that are evoked by each word
express the chaotic world of the day.""

VELTZ, "Hommage to home electronics"

"I have interested in junk materials and have made sound works since
several years ago. Before then, I listened experimental music as a fan, but
my border of music and non music became meaningless by encounter with
Fluxus, sound-art, media-art and others. Since then, I love texture of
"sound" itself. I remarked abandoned analog televisions when transmitting
system of broadcast signal was changed to digital format in 2011. They are
one of my favorite instrument at present, and I hold live performance and
installation used them. In this CD, I used analog TV, cassette tape
recorder and video player. However, their sounds are not manipulated, and I
recorded their spontaneous machine noise only. Are These one of
"experimental music"? I think it may be "discovered music". Obviously, I
cannot leave from the fascination of ordinary equipments in my life."

M.S. WALDRON-Steven STAPLETON-S.B. SIGMARSSON-Jim HAINES-R.K. FAULHABER,
"The sleeping moustache"
HELEN SCARSDALE
Let's begin with the introductions. M.S. Waldron may be best known for his
work as irr. app. (ext.), an unwieldy moniker that begets uncanny,
hallucinatory sound. Steven Stapleton is the genius behind Nurse With
Wound, the consistently unpredictable project that scrambles musical
obsessions for krautrock, surrealism, and avant-garde composition into a
brash quest for expressionism through experimentation. Sigtryggur Berg
Sigmarsson hails from the Icelandic electro-absurdist duo Stilluppsteypa,
which continues to investigate the finer points of drunken minimalism. Jim
Haynes prefers to merely state that he rusts things. R.K. Faulhaber is
something of a mysterious figure, looming around Mr. Waldron's irr. app.
(ext.) recordings and performances while keeping his own work a hermetic
secret. Each with a peculiar understanding of the audio arts, these five
artists came to the proverbial table and thought it a good idea to
collaborate. Given the predilection for the surreal and the sidereal that
each of these five employ in their many audio and visual projects, those
agendas oozed from the recordings that became known as The Sleeping
Moustache. An epiphany of controlled disorder, a convulsion of beauty, a
cascade of thought from delirious minds, The Sleeping Moustache is an
exquisite manifestation of sound poetry scattered into a tortuous collage
mired in an oblique melancholy. Magnetic tones extracted from the ether,
mechanical sounds smeared into a lugubrious growls, horns trumpeting
straight out of John's Book of Revelation, ululations sliced into
information overload that Schwitters himself would be proud of. The
Sleeping Moustache presents a psychically instable landscape, where dreams
and nightmares wreak havoc upon the drudgery of daily life. The closest
audible territory for The Sleeping Moustache might be the psychoactive
constructions of Nurse With Wound's Homotopy To Marie, although the
characters in this drama happened upon an entirely different map of that
terrain. The artwork for the first edition of The Sleeping Moustache
features five letterpress prints from each of the artists with an edition
of 1700.

Trevor WISHART, "Machine"
PARADIGM DISCS
"Although Machine was completed in 1971 it was not released until 1972,
shortly after the release of Journey Into Space. Machine is therefore the
first major composition by Trevor Wishart. It was composed at York
University and was originally issued on vinyl as 3 sides of a highly
adventurous 3LP box set called Electronic Music From York, released by the
University's own record label. In common with Journey Into Space (also on
Paradigm Discs), Machine makes use of a large number of volunteer
contributors, mostly from the student body at York. With this recording,
however, there are no instruments used. Instead, the music of Machine is
made up entirely from a combination of spoken text and carefully directed
improvising choirs that take their lead from prerecorded factory sounds.
These are extensively mixed and edited with yet more collected machine
sounds and other sources of musique conce, as well as occasional us=
e of
basic electronic sources. The scale of this work, and the degree of
preparation involved in scoring it, seem to have more resonances with the
world of theatre or film rather than tape composition. Much of Wishart's
early work involved the use of musicians and artists being directed to
perform in new ways, outside of their usual remit. A combination of late
60s openness, detailed scores that provide frameworks for improvisation and
slavish editing have resulted in an incomparable sound work. With a
continuous playing time of one hour, the wild and previously unexplored
terrain covered by this pioneering work of British experimental music moves
in turn through the full range of possible audio landscapes from the
oceanic calm of the doldrums to earsplitting factory mayhem. Jewel case cd

Joji YUASA, "Background sound in textile pavillion of Expo'70" - Obscure
Tape Music of Japan vol.14
OMEGA POINT
At the EXPO '70 in Osaka, many avant-garde artists contributed
architectural, space, environmental design and sound works. In the Textile
Pavillion ("Sen-i Kan" in Japanese), Japanese composer Joji Yuasa and
filmmaker Toshio Matsumoto presented a remarkable experimental event,
"Space Projection 'Ako'" for multi-channel tape music and image projection.
Also included in the presentation at the Pavillion was background sound for
several spaces and objects, composed by Joji Yuasa, mainly. This original
master tape was provided by Yoshimasa Matsumoto, the sound operator at the
Pavillion, who was also a sound engineer for '60s film and television which
included "Ultra Q," "Ultraman" and others. For the first track, "Music For
'Pattern-Slide 'Mon'yoh'," abstract textile images were projected on the
walls of a corridor ("Mon'yoh" means graphical patterns). This concrete
sound was composed specially for this space. "Music For 'Colourful World'"
(by unknown mixer) was played and recorded by three electric guitar
players. "White World" involved the same interior space as "Colourful
World," except it was painted white, in contrast to "Colourful World."
Music for this room was made out of sound material from "Projection
Esemplastic" and "Icon For White Noise," both important electronic works
from Yuasa's early years. "Voices Of Dolls" featured a group of tall,
gentleman-like dolls set in a lobby space, accompanied by meaningless text
in Japanese, English and Portuguese coming out of them. The Japanese
version is a part of Yuasa's concrete work, "Voices Coming." An English
version (by Joseph Love) and a Portuguese version (by Joaquim M. Benoetez)
were recorded for this project. For "Voice Of 'Raven' Objects" (by unknown
mixer) the artist Masunobu Yoshimura created ravens and arranged them here
and there on the Pavillion. The accompanying sound was made from modulated
Noh chant and lines from a story coming out of the mouths of the ravens.
"Background Sound Of Central Dome" was taken from events such as "Space
Projection 'Ako'" that took place in the dome space of the Pavillion. This
background sound was prepared from marimba modulated by a square wave.
Premiere recordings on disc, housed in a cardboard paper gatefold sleeve in

Joji YUASA, "Miniatures of concrete works" - Obscure Tape Music of Japan
vol.12
OMEGA POINT
Obscure Tape Music of Japan vol. 12. Edition Omega Point presents work by
legendary Japanese composer Joji Yuasa - one of most important composers in
Japan after World War II. "Nadja, Twincling in Stars" (1963) is the
incidental music, by NHK Radio, based on "Nadja" by Andre Breton who made
"Declaration of Sur-Realisme." The actual chart of constellations was
played by three players (violin, piano and vibraphone) which was used as
the music score. Birdsong, electronics, and sound generated from inside the
piano using music conce techniques were constructed at the NHK
Electronic Music Studio where Yuasa's first so-called pure electronic piece
"Projection Esemplastic For White Noise" was made in the same year of 1963.
"Music For A Cenotaph For Industrial Victims" (1972) was set in the woods
of Tama Hills, in the suburb of Tokyo. The music consists of echoing wooden
bells in the woods, made from lowered marimba moderated by square wave,
various metamorphosed sounds reminiscent of industrial work to accompany
the offering flowers by the attendants, and again, more reverberant sounds
of wooden bells. "Music For The Main Pavillion Of The Okinawa Oceanic Expo"
(1975) is a musique conce work which was made for the Oceanic Expo =
in
Okinawa prefecture in 1975. Folk music with an indigenous stringed
instrument (Jamisen), voices of various sea birds, the engine sound of a
boat, and metamorphosed instrumental sounds reminiscent of the wind and
waves combined with orchestral chamber music. Italian folk song "To The
Sea" is arranged for chamber orchestra and recorded by the composer as an
important sound source of this work. Limited edition of 500 copies only.

Back in stock ! "Joji Yuasa composed for some theatrical drama in his early
years. This CD contains two works of them, "Mittsu no Sekai" (Three Worlds,
1959) and "Oen" (A Woman named 'En', 1963). "Mittsu no Sekai" is
constructed from orchestral composition and tape sound : music concrete.
This mid-section seems industrial music. Actually he was influenced upon
Edgar Varese in his earliest years. On the work "Oen", all the
metamorphosed sound made from concrete sounds are used and combined for a
tragic story of a woman in Edo era, named 'En' who was put in prison for
forty years. This music concrete work aims not only depicting the
situation, but also lighting up heroine's dark passion, conscious and
subliminal mind and psychological demension. Their deep sound materials are
made from amplified inner-played piano, snapped long coil and others."

Dear Students,

Please read through these important notices about Spring 2017 registration:

The deadline to finalize your lottery selections is

next Wednesday, November 23rd at 12:00 PM

f you have not yet seen your adviser and had your course selections=
 approved, you must do so before this deadline.

Remember to enter a value into the "Total ITP credits requested" box on you=
r registration page and to hit the "Submit Choices" box to save your select=
ions! If you do not enter a value, the default is 0 and you will not get an=
y courses in the lottery!

Do not include Thesis, Internship or classes from other departments in your=
 total credits requested box, or in your course selections!

Your lottery results will post to your Albert accounts on Wednesday, Novemb=
er 30th.

You may add or drop classes from your schedule in Albert up until Sunday, F=
ebruary 5th, which is the end of the add/drop period for Spring 2017.

All ITP courses will have waiting lists of 3 people. If you are placed on a=
 waiting list for a course, it is your responsibility to make sure you have=
 enough room in your schedule for the course to be added without exceeding =
18.0 units!

If you have

not

set up your schedule with enough room for the course to be added without go=
ing over 18.0 units, if you are in position 1 and someone drops the course,=
 you will be skipped and the next person in line on the waiting list will b=
e added to the course.

A helpful tip:

if you join a waiting list for a course

after

the lottery results are posted, you can set up a swap function! If you have=
 a swap function set up, the system will automatically drop a course from y=
our schedule (that you designate upon joining the waiting list) to make roo=
m for the waitlisted course, should you be in position 1 and someone from t=
he course drops.

Waiting lists generated from the lottery will not have the option for swap =
functions.

Waiting list results will post to Albert along with the rest of the lottery=
 results on Wednesday, November 30th.

Effective at 5:00 PM today, all ITP students will be granted Albert access =
for Spring 2017.

ITP courses cannot be added to your schedules at this time

(they will manually post to your accounts on Wednesday, November 30th). How=
ever, please feel free to begin to register for any courses in outside depa=
rtments that you intend on taking.

ITP students may only register for graduate-level courses approved by your =
academic adviser.

You should reach out to the sponsoring department to inquire about specific=
 class enrollment permissions. If you need assistance obtaining enrollment =
permissions for any classes in outside departments, or if you need help sea=
rching in Albert for classes in outside departments, please come see me.

Hi Alicia,


This is Gao from Apt 3H, 350 W 43rd St. writing to you becaus=
e my lease ends on November 30th this year, and I have a question on rene=
wal. As much as wlike to keep this apartment, due to a prospe=
ctive job relocation sometime next year, it seems unfeasible for us to re=
new our lease for another whole year. Hence my question is, is it possibl=
e for us to stay in the same apartment after November on instead of a ful=
l-year lease but a month-by-month, or quarter-by-quarter basis=3F


Best,
GAO Yuan

Hello Erin,

This is Yuan, Niu Nihusband. Thank you for the catering informa=
tion, it was quite thorough and helpful. However therone piece =
of information missing: Last time at the Green House, me and my wife saw a =
nice little ice cream cart of yours from which the ice cream was served, an=
d it wasmentioned in the brochure. Wlike to know th=
at, does it come with the purchase of one or more of the 3-gallon tubs (bei=

Please let me know.

Best regards,

Hi Florence,

Thank you so much for the listings! Niuniu and I looked through them and
found the condos *251 7TH St 5F* and *101 Warren St A3I *particularly
interesting. If possible we'd like to go see these two properties first.
Any time from this weekend to the weekdays next week should work.

Thanks! And, I don't know if NYU has notified you that their online
application has been extended to Dec. 15, due to some difficulties in

Subject: Youtube Watch List Chris Moorman
Mike Matusow vs Chris Moorman WSOP Europe

in this video C.M. shows us how to play perfect poker: when he led the flop
with 22, and M.M. raised him, he knew that M.M. didn't have a 3 in that
spot. The other possibilities would be over pairs, a 9, or a flush draw.
Since M.M. only limped pre-flop, it's highly likely to be the latter two.
Realizing this, C.M. opted to just call instead of 3-bet, for 2 reasons: 1,
the stack size is a bit awkward to shove and push a better hand away, plus
if M.M did have a 9 he might make a crying call putting us on flush draw;
2, if he just 3-bet, M.M might 4-bet-shove with a flush draw and he'd be
forced to lay down 22.

We then see that C.M. led again on the turn, which was a great move in
tandem with his flat call on the flop, the reason being that if M.M. was
really on a draw, this bet on the turn should be able to make him fold.

Hello doctor,

This is Luckparent, Yuan. like to seek advice from =
you about a condition that Lucky has since yesterday, possibly related to a=
n incident around two months ago, which was as the following:

That night at around 11pm at home we found Lucky in a strange state: he was=
 sort of twitching/trembling and panting, losing his appetite and normal mo=
tor function. It lasted for about an hour so we took him to an emergency ho=
spital (The Animal Medical Center), and the doctor there said, after examin=
ation, that Lucky had hurt his back due to jumping down from heights. After=
 taking the pain reliever, he soon recovered the next day.

Recently me and my wife are traveling outside the country, and we have trus=
ted Lucky with a friend. Last night the friend called and said that Lucky w=
as showing the same symptoms like the last time he hurt his back, after a m=
oment of excited activities. We told the friend to let Lucky rest overnight=
, and she confirmed this morning that Lucksymptoms had alleviat=
ed, that he would start eating and peeing again, though still seemed not fu=
lly recovered. I wonder if inecessary for Lucky to have a check=
out at the hospital as soon as possible?

Best,

Yuan Gao

Hello Ben,

I'm so sorry for my late response. It's been too busy a week for me that I
haven't got the time to read the questionnaire but I will very soon. In the
mean time I'm in the process of liquidating some assets in Hong Kong, and
am still not sure whether I'll need mortgage at all, and how much if I do.
But I'll definitely get back to you on this soon.

Best,

Yuan

Hello,

My name is Yuan Gao, I just moved into Ivy Tower at 350 W 43rd St. The
building manager recommended your company and said that you would offer a
discount on blinds/shades. I might not stay long here so I'm looking for
roller shades that seem the best fit. I would need 3 panels each around 30'

Good Morning, Anne! I was caught up in something last night.

Frankly I don't like 150 Myrtle Ave: it's hard to find parking; the condo
is smaller than I'd hoped for. The location is nice and convenient though.

I think I'll keep searching.

Best, Yuan

This is Luckparents. Last week we switched Lucky=E2dog food from Orijen to Eukanuba Weight-Control. Since then we=E2e noticed that quickly after each meal, Lucky would vomit some of =
the dog food out. This vomiting had not happened after he was given treat=

Subject: Youtube Watch List Chris Moorman
Mike Matusow vs Chris Moorman WSOP Europe

in this video C.M. shows us how to play perfect poker: when he led the flop
with 22, and M.M. raised him, he knew that M.M. didn't have a 3 in that
spot. The other possibilities would be over pairs, a 9, or a flush draw.
Since M.M. only limped pre-flop, it's highly likely to be the latter two.
Realizing this, C.M. opted to just call instead of 3-bet, for 2 reasons: 1,
the stack size is a bit awkward to shove and push a better hand away, plus
if M.M did have a 9 he might make a crying call putting us on flush draw;
2, if he just 3-bet, M.M might 4-bet-shove with a flush draw and he'd be
forced to lay down 22.

We then see that C.M. led again on the turn, which was a great move in
tandem with his flat call on the flop, the reason being that if M.M. was
really on a draw, this bet on the turn should be able to make him fold.

Hello doctor,

This is Luckparent, Yuan. like to seek advice from =
you about a condition that Lucky has since yesterday, possibly related to a=
n incident around two months ago, which was as the following:

That night at around 11pm at home we found Lucky in a strange state: he was=
 sort of twitching/trembling and panting, losing his appetite and normal mo=
tor function. It lasted for about an hour so we took him to an emergency ho=
spital (The Animal Medical Center), and the doctor there said, after examin=
ation, that Lucky had hurt his back due to jumping down from heights. After=
 taking the pain reliever, he soon recovered the next day.

Recently me and my wife are traveling outside the country, and we have trus=
ted Lucky with a friend. Last night the friend called and said that Lucky w=
as showing the same symptoms like the last time he hurt his back, after a m=
oment of excited activities. We told the friend to let Lucky rest overnight=
, and she confirmed this morning that Lucksymptoms had alleviat=
ed, that he would start eating and peeing again, though still seemed not fu=
lly recovered. I wonder if inecessary for Lucky to have a check=
out at the hospital as soon as possible?

Best,

Hello Ben,

I'm so sorry for my late response. It's been too busy a week for me that I
haven't got the time to read the questionnaire but I will very soon. In the
mean time I'm in the process of liquidating some assets in Hong Kong, and
am still not sure whether I'll need mortgage at all, and how much if I do.
But I'll definitely get back to you on this soon.

Best,

Subject: inquiry about roller shades
Hello,

My name is Yuan Gao, I just moved into Ivy Tower at 350 W 43rd St. The
building manager recommended your company and said that you would offer a
discount on blinds/shades. I might not stay long here so I'm looking for
roller shades that seem the best fit. I would need 3 panels each around 30'
wide. Please give me a rough quote, Thanks!

Good Morning, Anne! I was caught up in something last night.

Frankly I don't like 150 Myrtle Ave: it's hard to find parking; the condo
is smaller than I'd hoped for. The location is nice and convenient though.

I think I'll keep searching.

Best, Yuan

Hello Dr. Yoshida,


This is Luckparents. Last week we switched Lucky=E2dog food from Orijen to Eukanuba Weight-Control. Since then we=E2e noticed that quickly after each meal, Lucky would vomit some of =
the dog food out. This vomiting had not happened after he was given treat=

Hi Charlie,

The pay stubs that I previously received (sometime from last year) had the
more "detailed" section along with them, as shown in the attachment here.
Is it possible that you can send me those parts from the September pay
stubs also? I really appreciate your help.

Best,

Gao, Yuan

Hello Dr. Yoshida

Thank you so much for your advice. I only have a few petty questions:

1, When we say "cup", is it the same as the measure "cup" that we use in
human cooking?

2, We'd like to change to a different brand for Lucky, however we
still have some Orijen left. Would you say ok if we feed Lucky 1/4 cup each
meal, a total of 1/2 cup per day that is 250 Cal/day? We can even reduce it
to less than 1/4 cup per meal, so there's still room for treat.

3, Would you recommend using GREENIE (which is of course
extra calories), or just brush his teeth instead?

Best,
Gao

Hello!

1.  Yes - measuring cup (8oz cup) will do!

2.   You may have to offer her a little less than 1/4 cup twice a day with
Orijen since a greenie is usually about 30 to 40 kcal/treat!

3.  Let's do both - Greenie and brushing teeth.

Hope this helps!

MY name is Yuan Gao (BP#928611). I rented a monthly parking space on Nov 15
at the MP 41 LL, 475 W 41st St, my parking number being #44. Yest=
erday I
received an invoice of $350 whose due date was Dec 1, and I have some
questions about it:

Firstly, my starting date with MPS was on Nov 15, and I've already paid a
monthly fee of $350 in advance. Shouldn't I be billed on the starting date
of the next period, Dec 15, instead of Dec 1, only half a month after I
paid the first time?

Secondly, I was going to apply for Manhattan resident parking tax exemption
prior to my second monthly payment, which I thought was on Dec 15, and that
should reduce my tax.

Please let me know why I am billed again only half a month after the first
payment, and whether my applying to tax exemption will lead to a lower
second payment.

Best regards,

Yuan Gao

Good morning Claudia,

Thank you very much. I just got a new bill of $198 for Dec 15 ~ 31, is that
the corrected one? Also I paid the last invoice of $350 on Dec 1 on
mpsparking.com, with a credit card ending in 7977. Please cancel that
transaction for me.

Best,

Yuan

HEY,

HERE'S THE LINK TO THE FIRST BATCH OF VIDEOS:

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u159a1lpftn7kwk/AADeKWrJv8pY0-14vr_sYd4ia?dl=0


THE LOGIC IS SIMPLE: WE'RE CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN TWO BOTS IN THE
CHARACTERS WE ASSIGN THEM, USING FOOTAGES OF THE CORRESPONDING
PERSONALITIES THAT WE GATHERED.

SOME SUGGESTED TREATMENTS OF THE VIDEOS:
- CUT THE PERSONS'S SPEECHES INTO COHERENT AND COMPLETE SENTENCES, AS MANY
AS POSSIBLE; THESE WILL BE USED AS RAW MATERIALS LATER.
(IF YOU'RE TECHNICALLY LIMITED TO DO SO, MARK THE TIMES WHERE EACH SENTENCE
STARTS AND ENDS.)
- ATTACH A TRANSCRIPTION TO EACH OF THE SENTENCES.
- GATHER MORE MATERIALS IF POSSIBLE.

Hello Amber,

The manager in the new building just informs me that the moving time on
Sunday is 1pm - 5pm. So I wonder if it's too early for your moving team to
arrive at my place before 9:30 am?

Also I'll update with you the actual inventory tomorrow.

Best.

Hi,

Thanks for reaching back. We now have Central American Wood Turtles &
Eastern Box Turtles. We'll ship with courier services like DHL to ship them
to any address you provide in HK. We guarantee that the turtles will exit
the US while constantly tracking them until they reach HK.

Please give Alex a call at +1-718-588-8886 to further discussion and
clarification.

Thank you.

Subject: Fwd: First Notice: Documentation needed to process your claim
Hello,

This is Lucky's parent Yuan. Thank you for sending Lucky's insurance claim
for me as per my request from the last visit. The insurance company would
now need all of Lucky's medical records, which I believe Hudson Animal
Hospital has kept a copy of. Could you kindly send them to Healthy Paws on
my behalf, please? Thank you very much.

Best,
Yuan

Hi Sarah,

I just want to find out  if there's any news on my I-20 application. Please
let me know how things are going, because I'm a bit worried about the
limited time for a change of status application.

Hello Dan,

This is Yuan Gao from the 1st-years. I have waived ICM for the past two
weeks, but now find myself in need of taking the class. I need your
approval for joining your class on Wed 12:10--2:20.

I have experience in Processing and several programming languages that I
think I can make up for the curriculum of the past two weeks by myself.

Hi Tedb0t,

Sorry I was too sick the past few days to reply. What I was referring to in
my midterm rant was actually something to be found in the ancient Chinese
literature about the acoustics and psychoacoustics of sound, as well as
some near-past acoustic technologies (some mentioned in Joseph
Needham's Science and Civilisation in China). But now I think that might be
more suitable for a final project of the class. So I'm going to edit my
midterm paragraph and focus on some self-made hydrophone and underwater
recordings.

Best,

Yuan (Ian) Gao

Hi John,

My name is Yuan and I'm a new NYU student in the Interactive
Telecommunications Program starting this semester. I signed up for
Dreamhost during a workshop and chose to enroll in the 1-year educational
promotion, but only to find out later that a more desirable 2-year
promotion has been added afterwards. So I informed one of your coworkers,
Jason Sigal, and he said that you could help to make an adjustment for me,
i.e. from 1-year discount to the 2-year discount.

Subject: Inquiry about change of status from H1B to F1
Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a new international student for the Fall semester in Tisch ITP. My id#
is N15764129. Here is my question:

I am currently working on H1B visa in the US, but am going to end my
contract with my company before the Fall semester begins. I have filed a
Form I-539 to USCIS for a Change of Status from H1B to F1 without leaving
the country, and they have received it on Apr. 28, 2015. However, after 3
months have passed I still haven't heard from USCIS. I'd want to know that,
in the worst-case scenario, is it possible for me to register as a
full-time student for the Fall semester, provided that my Change of Status
is still pending with USCIS by then? And also, what are the
implications/consequences if I were to terminate my H1B status with my
company before September, but hasn't received approval on Change of Status
by then?

Sincerely,

Yuan Gao

Subject: need approval for joining Body Electric
Hello Conor,

My name is Yuan Gao (student id yg1349), currently having my 2nd
semester in ITP. I just discovered your course Body Electric and
instantly fell in love with it. I have been planning on a new project
that involves lucid dream-inducing and -interacting techniques, and
your course seems like a perfect site for it to happen.

I have a master's in Electrical Engineering but right now want to make
a transition to art, while at the same time keeping my feet wet with
electronics/software. Right now I'm envisioning a lot of possible
forms for my project, including smart-phone/watch/web app,
audio/visual work in MaxMSPJitter/Processing/openFrameworks, and/or
physical installation, with the help of various sensors being taught
in your class.

I have successfully enrolled in the course and hope you'll approve my
enrollment. Although I have missed the first class, I'll try to make
it up by asking my classmates who's in the class and learn about the
materials I missed.

Best,
Yuan

Hi Jeff,
I have a question about our kinetic device challenge. What do you mean by
"as much light as possible"? How is it to be measured? Is it by the
brightness, the number of LEDs lighting up at the same time, or something
else?

Hi Jacqueline

This is so unexpected, because I have done exactly that two weeks ago,
during walk-in hours. I honestly don't know what went wrong that The system
failed to register me. Is it possible that you can confirm with the OGS
about that?

Thank you

Dear Omer/Tal:

Sorry for missing out this morning. I had such a headache when I woke up,
and lost all energy that I couldn't get out of bed.

Is it okay that I start sending out emails to try to contact the
manufacturers, while also searching for the self adhesive film and bring in
what I find on Friday?

Best,

Hi Ondina

Take a look at this page:
https://github.com/lmccart/SocialHacking/wiki/Spring-2016-Assignments#assignment-0-due-127

You'll get a better idea at what the class is about, but remember,
check out the Fall 2013/2014 Syllabus/Assignment that's listed on the
right side in the same page, as I think this year's class will be very
similar.

The class from now on proceeds on (a class week followed by a
meeting-with-instructor week) cycle, so next week there's will be no
class but to meet with the assigned instructor to talk about their
ideas for assignment.

Hello,

My name is Yuan Gao, currently a first-year student in the ITP program of
NYU. I saw an email on the ITP mailing list from your company seeking
part-time creative technologist, and I'd like to give
it a try.

Here's my portfolio:

yuangao.squarespace.com

I came from a background of engineering, but have recently come to focus on
new media content creation, design, and art. Here's my resume:

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Hello Tom,

How's going? How's your break so far? Hope you're enjoying it.

I need your approval for an internship opportunity I have. It's a startup
called Outernet whose work is very much relevant to the curriculum of ITP.
I'd like to take 2 credits for it, a total of ~80 hours working with them.

I'm so sorry for my absence and having not notified you or Renata. I stayed

Hi Johanna,

This is so weird. At least there should be record of me checking-in? I
mean, the system should at least know that I visited during the second
week of the semester, because I've signed up to get a waiting number?

I really couldn't confirm the details of my check-in. I was received
by a lady whose name I couldn't remember, who also told me that the
person who was responsible for Tisch ITP wasn't away during that week.

If there's really nothing in the system, the only thing I can do is to
walk in again with all the documents, right? What else can I do?

Thanks,
Yuan

Sorry about that, and thanks for canceling those spots becuase I won't be
able able to attend them due to conflict with class.

I didn't know you were working on your thesis, sorry about that. I have
some issue with an effect I was trying to implement in Three.js, so I got
in touch with you for I heard you're an expert in Three.js.

Is it possible that I send you the link to my code on Github, and briefly
describe the problem I encountered?

Best
Yuan

Subject: Re: Next Thursday?
Hi Jesse,

Sorry for the delayed reply. I need to talk to you about this.

Last week I checked with the Global Student Office of NYU, and they
said I couldn't use school credit for any internship during this
semester, because international student who's on student visa cannot
work during their first year in school. So starting from this week I
ended up having to take 5 classes for this semester, without having
any available credit slot for internship.

To be frankly the workload has been pretty heavy for me, and my wife
is also complaining about me not spending enough time at home. The
opportunity to work with CultureHub is really exciting, but I'm really
afraid that extra workload will make me stressed out. In light of the
situation, I think I might not be working any internship job this
semester.

Sorry for not being able to inform you earlier, and it's really
unfortunate for me not able to work on such an invigorating project. I
hope everything goes well with your project.

Best,

Yuan

Hi, happy new year!

I'm excited about our performance class this spring, but before then, I
wanted to let you know about some performance happenings in NYC this month.
I am really bummed because I'm out of town, but there is a lot of great,
weird, interesting stuff, I hope you have a chance to check some of it out.

There are four festivals going on that include a mix of performance art,
theater, dance, and music -- American Realness <http://americanrealness.com=
>,
COIL Festival <http://www.ps122.org/coil-2016/>, Under the Radar Festival
<http://publictheater.org/en/Programs--Events/Under-the-Radar-Festival/>,
and Gray Spaces
<http://contemporaryperformance.com/sfx/portfolio/gray-spaces-2/>.

They all have various performances worth checking out, some may resonate
with you more than others. If I were in town, I would want to see these
ones:

   - Angela Washko, Tightrope Routines
   <http://contemporaryperformance.com/sfx/portfolio/3-tightrope-routines-a=
-feminist-artist-interviews-the-internets-most-infamous-misogynist/>

   <http://www.ps122.org/yesterday-tomorrow/?gclid=3DCJLZh_qSjsoCFQ9afgodXn=
QJPQ>
    (COIL)
   - Royal Osiris Karaoke Ensemble, Art of Luv

   - Panoply Performance Laboratory (PPL), Embarrassed of the Whole #15
   <http://contemporaryperformance.com/sfx/portfolio/7-embarrassed-of-the-w=
hole-15/>
(Gray
   Spaces)
   - Jillian P, Panopticon <http://www.ps122.org/panopticon/> (COIL=
)
   - Toshiki Okada, God Bless Baseball
   <http://publictheater.org/Tickets/Calendar/PlayDetailsCollection/UTR/201=
6/God-Bless-Baseball/>
(Under
   the Radar) - read an interview with him here
   <http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/theater/the-playwright-toshiki-okada-=
finds-an-audience-in-the-us.html>
   .

These are just a few, this article
<http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/in-the-nyc-theater-world-january-is-festi=
val-month-8083226>
describes some other highlights, and there's a lot more you may want to
just browse the festival sites.

I hope you find something that moves, confuses, or intrigues you. If you
end up seeing any, I'd love to hear your thoughts in the first class.

Enjoy your break!
Lauren

Hi Jackie,

I just found out that there's a mistake with my enrollment status. I was
paying for me and my wife's fall 2016 Basic Plans, but the system somehow
mistakenly enrolled me as a Single with Comrehensive Plan.

Is it possible to downgrade my status to Basic while also enroll my wife in
the same? I will pay for the balance if there's any. I appreciate your help.

Best,
Gao

I have a bare site set up, just to prompt instructions to people. I like
your suggestion and I think we can instruct them to response either
digitally or on paper. Are you able to meet at ~2:40 before class, so we

This is Yuan and we talked yesterday. I've been giving some thought on the =
task, and my own school schedule, and decided that I could work up to 12 ho=

I don't know whether that'll work out for you. Please let me know if you wa=

Hi Helen,

I just called OGS to try to get an estimated time for my wife's I-20
approval, and the answer I got was tremendously worrying. The person said
it might take 3 to 4 weeks from now, and that's drastically different from
what I was told when I dropped off the documents more than 10 days ago,
when I was told it takes 10 bussiness days for the I-20 to come back. Me
and my wife have already booked our tickets and our schedule is very tight,
we can definitely not afford to wait that long, coz by then we'll not be in
the US. And we still need the I-20 to make an appointment for visa
interview on July 28th in Shanghai, while there's still open slots. Please
help me out with this situation, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Jeff,

So sorry about that, I was so sick this morning I couldn't make it to the
floor. I hope I can make up for it, preferably not in the next class coz I
don't want to take up people's time. Do you think it possible I put my
presentation online (audio+slides) and send out the links to the class, so
I won't totally miss this major presentation?

Hey guys,

I'm thinking we could do something where we are using the webcam and we're =
not in class but we're chatting with our classmates. We can be on the floor=
 or somewhere in the Tisch building. I guess might be fun to try not to be =
physically in class only on the web for the exercise. Shawn could give the =

Friday around 11am or 12pm?

Thank you!

Nick,

I'm currently storing each record in the db as one table of (file id, tag, =
probability), and today I'm going to create a 2nd table of (filename, md5, =
filepath in the os) to account for the fact that some files might get modif=
ied or deleted to keep the db in sync.

As for retrieval, currently I think as long as we have enough images (hence=
 tags), we are guaranteed to get similar results based on matching tags alo=
ne. I'm researching on ways to match images based not only on exact tag-mat=
ching, but also semantically silimar tags
I'm on a plane right now going to LA. I'll get the db ready by tonight. Cou=
ld you do me a favor by telling Laura that we need to subscribe to Clarifai=
 for $20/month? Because we need to get around the 5000 units/month and 1000=
 units/hour limit.

Thanks a lot.

Subject: Re: Viacom fellowship
We possess the essential technical skills for producing VR contents, e.g.
3D modeling, 3D rendering, JavaScript/C# programming, etc.

We have past experience with hardware and software such as Oculus Rift,
Gear VR, Unity/Unreal, Maya, and Vuforia.



We will be actively exploring new contexts to embed our skills and past
experience in, focusing on creating novel narratives and pushing forward
the existing boundary of VR experience in a more experimental direction.

We will also try to investigate and develop new ways for VR experiences to
involve multiple users and for the experiences to render and unfold in real
time.

We also consider combining VR experience with the most accessible
interfaces like browsers and mobile devices, by e.g. using the latest
specifications in WebVR, and strive to expand and enhance the Web contents
with the enabling power of VR.




We have demo-ed one VR project in the VR lab, which is about gesture
control in VR, using android wears to recognize gestures by detecting the
orientations. People from and outside of ITP (Interactive Telecommunication
Program) in NYU have tried our demos, including developers, engineers,
artists, designers, professors, as well as some friends of ours that wasn't
familiar with the technology back then.




VR for us not only means a new standard of 360-degree medium format, but
also a future platform for social communication, content sharing, and
co-operation and connection between people. We believe that a
function-oriented switching between the virtual and the real world can help
people deal with limited time and space problems. We've been interested in
and devoting to developing VR-related concepts and projects for over 1 year.




Job Simulator resonates with us a lot, but not exactly what we intend to
achieve. This example involves an input interface that increases the
interaction between human and device.

Many VR projects or technology nowadays are focusing on virtual experience
for a single user who is receiving the content in a more passive way. What
we are interested in more is to let multiple users actively interact with
each others through VR. An inspiring example is Ken Perlin's Holojam. We

The VR content we are hoping to deliver to the audience is a demo
experience in which people can play with different musical instruments
(imagine virtual synthesizers, drum machines, and turntables alike...),
following a pre-programmed guide and real-time instructions to perform a
virtual music jamming, in a space whose backdrop, aesthetic setting, and
scale are otherwise nearly impossible to construct in the real world.

We hope that our audience will consider wanting to participate in, as
audience or musicians, a music concert of the future that happens purely in
VR. We'd also like them to think that VR is not something alien to our
existing world, not as a simulacrum or gamified environment, but something
that has the potential to elevate our existing experience to a higher realm.




We are hoping that Viacom, with its ongoing ventures and experience in
delivering VR contents, will help us greatly with setting up a
state-of-the-art environment that is both mature for development and
production, as well as help us refine our ideas and strategies in the
process.

Subject: Inquiry about possible scholarship/grant
Hello Midori,

This is Yuan from the first year. After two fulfilling semesters of study
in ITP, I had stumbled across some financial problem myself, and I'm
writing to you to seek for possible alleviation of my situation:

As we all know the tuition for ITP is not on the cheap side. Before I came
to ITP I had a full-time job so I was doing ok. However, due to my status
as an alien resident I had to give up my job to join ITP as a full-time
student. After two semesters and being recently married, I'm gradually
feeling the financial burden on me and my family. Right now I'm trying to
seek any possible scholarship/grant out there to ease my burden, and I
think it's reasonable to start with ITP first.

I'd be grateful if you could help me find out if there's any prospect of a
scholarship/grant from ITP/NYU for the next two semesters, or even just the
next? I'd be happy to provide materials for any kind of application.


Best,
Yuan Gao (yg1349)

Hey Yuan,

Since we didn't get the chance to chat last weekend, I'm wondering if you c=

In light of conversation with Laura and Lauren, I tried to develop a more t=
horough understanding of their goals and put together the notes in the emai=

Hi,

Has anyone successfully gotten the live video site up and running? I was 
running the new WebRTC sample code and I couldn't get back an ID.
Through debug tool it seemed that the *peer.on('open', cb)* event was never 
fired and the callback function was never executed. 
I tried pinging *liveweb.itp.io *and the server seemed alive and well...

Need help.

Hello Amy,

This is Yuan from the first year. The result for BS lottery is supposed to
be coming out by today the latest. However I haven't received any emails
stating whether or not I've been chosen.

Please let me know so I can make adjustment to my course selection, while
there's still time.

Best,
Yuan Gao

Amit,

That sounds very fun. I'm definitely interested. When would they need your
demo? Have you found a way to register the peeing event? Anyways, I'm
greatly interested and would like to know what needs to be done and how I
can contribute.

Hi Amit,

Sorry for such a late reply. I've been so busy these days working on
school's and my own projects that I hardly have time for anything else.

Are you still looking for people who can desgin the container for you? I
have many schoolmates here who have ample experience in 3d modeling and 3d
printing. Let me know if you still need a collaborator, and I'll find one
for you.

Best,
Yuan

Subject: student from NYU ITP seeking summer internship opportunity
Hello Felix,

My name is Yuan Gao, currently a first-year student in NYU ITP. I got your
email from a great guy named John Farrell in ITP, who has given us a
workshop on Enertiv and encouraged us to do projects with it. So I did a
project with the Enertiv data of ITP for my Energy class this semester
(taught by Jeff Feddersen), and I've just presented it yesterday in the
final class.

I've heard from John that Enertiv is probably looking for some interns, so
I took the liberty of applying for such a position with you (if such
openings do exist). In case you're interested in seeing what I did with the
Enertiv system, it's called

Forecasting Electric Energy Consumption of ITP Using Enertiv Energy
Monitoring System and Support Vector Machine for Regress

(sorry for the title) and here's the slides I've presented with in my class:

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDYve_cUuWzEdBpQBzAjwJcrT6Hq7yCSG8uuRjpp8MY/edit?usp=sharing

also the code for this project can be found here:
https://github.com/821760408-sp/itp-energy-forecast-with-enertiv

my resume can be seen on my portfolio website: www.ko-yuen.com/resume

I'm looking forward to hearing from you.


Best,

Yuan

Hi Lisa,

Sorry about not being able to confer and work together earlier. Both Perry

tonight.

I agree with you that it's hard to merge our projects together so hastily.
We do, however, have a finished console at our disposal. I will be around
the floor on Tuesday (i.e. tomorrow). If you have 15 minutes to spare I'd
love to show you some videos of how it worked out. There might still be
a chance of collaboration, however slim that is?

Anyways, please let me know.

Dear Students,

As a follow-up to my previous email, please read this important note about
Full-Time Equivalency and Financial Aid (specifically *scholarships*):

Equivalency is used to help students retain their eligibility for loans,
but it does not make a student eligible for scholarships. Scholarship
funding can be used ONLY to cover the actual cost of tuition generated by
enrollment in courses, that is, the actual number of units for which a
student is enrolled.

Please consult the Office of Financial Aid at 212-998-4444
<(212)%20998-4444> for more information if you have any concerns about how
going part-time, with full-time equivalency status in your final semester
will affect your financial aid package.

Dear Second Year Students,

If you are planning on going part-time during Spring 2017 and you are
receiving financial aid, have loans, or are an international student on a
visa that requires you to be full-time, *you will need to bring me a
completed Full-Time Equivalency Form.*

*The form, along with some very helpful information (including a breakdown
of the costs of going full-time versus part-time) can be found on this page
on the ITP Help site: *
*https://sites.google.com/a/itp.nyu.edu/help/curriculum/fulltime?pli=1
<https://sites.google.com/a/itp.nyu.edu/help/curriculum/fulltime?pli=1>*

First-years, take note that if you are planning on going part-time next
Spring, you want to take 18 credits in at least one semester as taking 16,
16, and 16 credits in your first three semesters will leave you with 12
credits to take in your final semester, and that is where the full-time
charge kicks in.

If you have any questions about part-time status, full-time equivalency, or
tuition and fee cost breakdowns - please email or visit me at the front
desk and I will be happy to help.

Hi Yuan Gao,

I'm not sure what resources at the Center for Data Science you're referring=
 to. Perhaps you mean the HPC system?

If so, you can find documentation for using the HPC here:

https://wikis.nyu.edu/display/NYUHPC/High+Performance+Computing+at+NYU

Using the HPC requires faculty approved access. As an adjunct, I am not abl=
e to approve your access. See this document for more info about access:

https://wikis.nyu.edu/display/NYUHPC/Getting+or+renewing+an+HPC+account

Hope that helps!

Best,

Patrick

ON ACCESSING CLARIFAI API:

This is the main program used to access Clarifai:

https://github.com/Sift-It-proto/clarifai-python
https://github.com/Sift-It-proto/clarifai-python
https://polymail.io/?utm_source=3Dpolymail&utm_medium=3Dreferral&utm_campai=
gn=3Dlink-preview

https://github.com/Sift-It-proto/clarifai-python

https://github.com/Sift-It-proto/clarifai-python

To use their API, yoneed the client id and secret for this proj=
ect I created on Clarifai.com:

Client ID

ytmIhyHIA8xWh5JPfrUZVrSJXrF3tFDHhwNvbLT

Client Secret

1s5MDKIfHvpcZZcZsrSMBU2AtJjFbNXGnF4VE5S

The installation is not much different from whain the README, e=
xcept that you need to install the

Pillow

package, and, if you wanna do database connection, the

mysql.connector

package

To tag/label a single image, yoonly need to run

./main.py <input_file>

; to tag multiple images in a folder, you need to run

./main.py -b <batch_size> <input_folder>

to specify how many images you want to send each batch, because Clarifai ha=
s a restriction of 128 images you can send at one time. The

potential pitfall

is that right now hardcoding the output file path, so you need =
to move the JSON response somewhere else manually before sending another re=
quest, so that the previous result doget overwritte(=
l fix this later)

Thabasically it! Let me know if you have any suggestions.

Check out this Processing sketch when you get the chance. It was a quick wa=
y to prototype the hover feature. Try hovering over different objects (if y=
ou click and, for now, hold you'll get a popup)
Check out the data folder. There are multiple images for each of the segmen=
ts. The segmented images have transparent backgrounds. What I am thinking i=
s to send each of these to clarifai to be tagged so that we have unique tag=
s that are absolutely correlated with features (selectable sub-images) in t=
he image. Talk more on the phone.

Hi Yuan,

It's not the client secret and ID I need, it's the actual email and passwor=
d used to log into their homepage, not to access the Clarifai application y=
ou created. It's probably the email you used to sign up for Clarifai. You p=
robably don't want to give me the password since it's linked to your email =
so I am curious if you can add an email address (mine) for logging in, or m=

What this means:

We need your help - so stay to lend a hand, even if it's cleaning up and re=
moving your old projects, the stuff you thought you had hidden behind or on=
 top of some locker or cabinet!

Everything not related to the Show should be off the floor with the close o=
f classes today!

If you had development or staging space you should already be cleaned up, o=
rganized and on hand to move your project to your Show location once the fu=
rnishings have been stored

If you can't help, OK, but the Floor will close from 8PM - 10PM while we di=
smantle everything and put things into storage so you'll have to excuse you=
rself

The Equipment Room is officially CLOSEDThe Mandatory Equipment and =
Space Checkin is tomorrow from 11AM - 4PM

We will allow On-Floor ONLY checkouts this evening but all equipment is due=
 back by the close of the dayYou may hold onto any embedded tech in=
 your project, but you should return monitors, projectors, Kinects, webcams=
, etc tonight so that we dispense everything for the Show tomorrowY=
ou may label that which you have been working with - there is painter's tap=
e in the ER

We will meet in the Lounge at 8PM after the Screening!

Hey All,

Attached is a link of my writeup of everything I know about your project (a=

The little one sentence descriptions of your projects are not anything we a=
re printing or displaying anywhere, they're just quick literal blurbs I wro=
te for myself to remember what each project is.

Let me know if you still thinking about doing your own visuals for your pro=
ject (like cool computer graphics or an image) instead of the detail camera=
.

Also the show order is listed on this document as well. Check the tabs at t=
he bottom of the document. This is the order we will use for the dress rehe=
arsal tomorrow night. It also has your buddy.

If you have

really strong reservationbout your placement, send me an email, but we would like to keep the=
 order we have listed
One last note: For the dress rehearsal tomorrow, treat it as if it was a re=
al performance.

If there are parts of your changeover that require assembly or calibration =
on stage lets practice that
Looking forward to it guys!

Hello
My name is Gao. It was my first time ordering from McMaster and apparently =
I've made a duplicate order
The orders, 3059776 and 3059665, were duplicated. I have already paid for 3=

'''
For all who's interested in using OpenCV for their Node.js projects.
'''

Came across this issue when I switched to a different laptop and tried to 
install the Node.js OpenCV binding node-opencv 
<https://github.com/peterbraden/node-opencv> there. 

After running

npm install -S opencv

from command line, the installation stopped at this error "ld: library not 
found for -llibtbb.dylib".

I googled the error and there hasn't been a consensus on how to solve this 
problem. After three hours grappling with all sorts of hacks I think I've 
found the "most definitive" solution so I'd like to share it here:

If you come across this exact same error, try the following steps in your 
terminal:

1, First make sure you have OpenCV installed in your computer. If you're 
using Mac OS and Homebrew, run

brew info opencv

to check. You must install opencv with the --with-tbb flag, i.e.

brew install opencv --with-tbb

2, Also make sure you have tbb and pkg-config installed. Using homebrew:

brew install tbb pkg-config

3, Make sure you have node-gyp <https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp> 
installed globally, i.e.

npm install -g node-gyp

4, Right now you should have a file called libtbb.dylib under 
/usr/local/lib. You may run 

[ -f /usr/local/lib/libtbb.dylib ] && echo "exists"

to make sure. 

5, You should also have a file called opencv.pc under 
/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig. 

-f /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/opencv.pc ] && echo "exists"

You may open it in your favorite text editor, e.g. Sublime Text, to edit 
it. Find the flag that says "-llibtbb.dylib" and replace it with 
'/usr/local/lib/libtbb.dylib". Save and close.

6, IMPORTANT. Run

brew uninstall opencv

to uninstall opencv from your computer, then run

brew install opencv --with-tbb

to install again. You should now be able to run

npm install opencv

to install node-opencv without the error in the title!!!!

Mastering Mavens,

Some thoughts:

1.

Anyone with FTP, Cyberduck, Fetch, WeTransfer, or other

file transfer

issues -- please bring your questions to class Wednesday.

2.

Here's a review of some key

soundBlade

stuffA. Selection

is the area that turns yellow when you click and drag across a section of a=
n EDLB. In and Out point[ are used to designate material you wish to edit, where [ i=
s the first sample and ] is the last. These are used to add, move or delete=
 material in a master. They are used in 2, 3 or 4-point versions, depending=
 on whether you want to Replace something in the Destination (and keep the =
overall running time as-is), or Insert something (which may change the over=
all time)
C. SRP

(Selection Reference Points) are the small yellow triangles that are placed=
 anywhere along the bottom of an EDL. Useful to ID verses, choruses, proble=
ms, potential edit spots -- anything you want to indicate. They can contain=
 text if you want. Double-click any SRP
D.

A

segment

is the portion of a waveform between two crossfades

. Every song starts out as a single segment. If you were to delete a chorus=
, the screen would now show 2 segments. It is still a single original sourc=
e file; just divided into x number of parts in the EDL. Creating a segment =
is how a portion of a song can be isolated for gain change, for example
E. M

enu

commands showing a

hotkey

are hard wired into the system. Anything without a hotkey requires a

QuicKeys

macro. If you want to use QKeys, do the basic installation from the zQuicKe=
ys folder I gave you in Folder 01. Be sure to read the

ReadMe

file. I'll configure it for you in class, and you'll have a lot more speed =
and flexibility
F.

To do a

Record (Capture)

, have an EDL in a Project's top position as Destination. Arm the EDL for r=
ecording by Option-clicking on its

R

button at the left side of the EDL. Open the

New Soundfile Prefs

widget to designate a

Path

for the capture, and also give the capture file a

N

ame

. Then a

Wild capture

can be started from wherever you click in the EDL by clicking on the green =
LED in the top Transport section of a Project. Stop the capture with the

spacebar

.

A variant of a wild capture is the

SRP capture

, in which sBlade records the time exactly between a pair of SRPs. Double-c=
lick in the space between two SRPs to Select the area; then click on the gr=
een LED as in a wild record. The system will stop itself at the final SRP. =
If you want to record from one SRP to another that has other SRPs in betwee=
n,

then click on the first SRP and SHIFT-CLICK on the final SRP

. That selects the entire area between them(Hint:

LOCK all SRPs in the track to keep the SRP from disappearing when the captu=
re file automatically places itself into the EDL when finished

.)

If you want the most efficient and satisfying result from your Mastering ef=
forts this term, then go ahead and try

QuicKeys

(see Item

E

above)Do the basic installation. Ask me to assist and configure it.=
 Try to arrive in Dolan early if you can.

Thanks all!

Hi Shawn,

Were you able to get Kurento running? I tried their tutorials but none of t=

14.04. I didn't look into their code for being afraid of a suckout of anoth=

Or is there any other similar open-source WebRTC media service out there? I=
 wanna try Twilio but was afraid their voice API would heavily compress the=
 audio stream I send out. Is that the case?

Hi Ian,

Yes, I was able to Kurento running on my digital ocean server and got some =
of the examples working last yearI don't recall which version of Ub=
untu it is/wasPerformance was iffy but I was running with limited m=
emory and so forth.

Not open source but I have had good experience with OpenTok's APITw=
ilio is geared towards voice so yes, I would expect that the stream is heav=
ily compressed with a voice codec such as g711 or the like.

Hope this helps,

Hi Nick,

I've uploaded every piece of code to our Github repo and our server.
THere's also a .sh file indicating how the code should be run.

If you're writing the final report to Laura, could you add that with our
prototype, it is now possible to, in real time, analyze images by tags and
colors, store this information into the database, and retrieve relevant
images from the database through matching tags and colors by variable
criteria. Thus we have completed a useful prototype for further development
in the future.

Please let me know (just generally) how you're planning to wrap it up~


Best,
Yuan

So sorry I just arrived in New York. I read your report and it's amazing. I=
 think you're getting the technical points across very well. I think I will=
 be joining you for the meeting tomorrow.

Yes I think the prototype can definitely be working by the end of the month=
. I'm a little sick today so I'm gonna write the Node module tomorrow. With=
 the amount of images at hand we're safe to say that a simple label matchin=
g of images will suffice for a retrieval task. After that, when time permit=
s, I can work on the next-level recommendation method, to retrieval images =
based not on exact label matchint semantic similarity.

Talk to you tomorrow.

Hey Yuan,

That's great. I think building that module is definitely the right next ste=
p. How long do you think it will take you to write?

Once you read the report, can you tell me if you think everything sounds go=
od? I want to develop a timeline and workflow for this project as soon as p=
ossible. I have been compiling resources that should help a lot with the co=
ding so I'm still thinking we could have a prototype by the end of the mont=
h. Let me know what you think.

Last thing -- I am starting to write image segmentation code for our purpos=
es using templates from OpenCV's documentation online. The output will be u=
sed for the HTML UI via Node. That's where I'm focusing my coding efforts a=
t the moment

 think you're getting the technical points across very well. I think I will=
 be joining you for the meeting tomorrow.

Yes I think the prototype can definitely be working by the end of the month=
. I'm a little sick today so I'm gonna write the Node module tomorrow. With=
 the amount of images at hand we're safe to say that a simple label matchin=
g of images will suffice for a retrieval task. After that, when time permit=
s, I can work on the next-level recommendation method, to retrieval images =
based not on exact label matchint semantic similarity.

Talk to you tomorrow.

Hey Yuan,

That's great. I think building that module is definitely the right next ste=
p. How long do you think it will take you to write?

Once you read the report, can you tell me if you think everything sounds go=
od? I want to develop a timeline and workflow for this project as soon as p=
ossible. I have been compiling resources that should help a lot with the co=
ding so I'm still thinking we could have a prototype by the end of the mont=
h. Let me know what you think.

Last thing -- I am starting to write image segmentation code for our purpos=
es using templates from OpenCV's documentation online. The output will be u=
sed for the HTML UI via Node. That's where I'm focusing my coding efforts a=
t the moment

Nick,

I've stored the metadata of the images into the database. I'm on the plane =
right now and will read your report during the flight. Since you're using N=
ode, let me know if you want me to write a simple module for database acces=
s and image retrieval. I can do that once I got back to New York.

Thanks,

Hi Nick,

Thanks for the info.

I have upgraded our Clarifai plan to $19/month, thus eliminating the 1000 u=
nits/hour limit on free account. I'll go ahead and annotate all the images =
we have right now, and save them all into our database.

In the meantime, could you please add me as an admin in our server? I might=
 need to install packages but don't wanna bother you with that every time d=

Everyone,

If your DigitalOcean droplet, like mine, has only a *meager* memory size of 
512MB, you might once in a while find your *npm install* command gets 
killed by the system, especially when the dependencies being installed are 
many, leaving nothing under the folder /node_modules/.bin, which means 
module installation has failed. In that case, adding a "swapfile" to your 
system might come to your rescue.

This article 
<https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-on-ubuntu-14-04#tweak-your-swap-settings> 
explains the steps of creating swapfile in great detail. 

Cheers.

Hello Rob,


This is Yuan from 2nd year.

I checked out a SensorTag from ER last semester for an installation, but I
couldn't find it right now and consider it lost.

I'm really sorry for that, and would like to compensate for it if I may.
Would you please un-ban me from ER?

Hey Yuan,

I did use HPC. My advice would be to read all the guides on the
https://wikis.nyu.edu/display/NYUHPC/High+Performance+Computing+at+NYU
, which is what I did. There's a bit of a learning curve, but you should be=
 able to figure it out pretty fast if you're familiar with Linux environmen=
ts.

Can't really give too much more general advice than that, because I'm not s=
ure exactly what you're trying to do. Let me know if you have any specific =
questions.

Good scenery to work with and has a lot of elements that would be super h=

Yua- you are coming back tomorrow, correct? We need to find a time =

I'm free tomorrow from 1-4, and on Tuesday morning.

How about we divide up the work?

By iterations of projections he means rough visual ideas?

I wasn't in class so I'm probably wrong, this is sort of how I understand i=

1) collecting basic imagery we lik

4) documenting it with the projections ready

5) putting together presentation

I will do no2 right now
If someone is available to set up the projection mapping tomorrow, we can t=

ps - - Just re-listened to all three songs Mathura sent. Wicked town is gre=

Origin of love we could go wild with, would be fun, childish drawings, vivi=

Looking at the model this evening after you left Mathura, Gustavo and I tho=
ught maybe it is better to put the 'ad screen' on the left, over the bar (w=
here it is now)

On the right it is a bit cramped

Looking at it now I think the car is too small.

Yuan we didnt go into such things very deeply so please feel free to write =
to us which song/s you are most interested in working on!

So as it is right now we have two projection surfaces: the ad screen, and t=

Right?

So about getting assets for the projection - I hope you don't mind me shari=

I love the ideas Daveeds's put up! Just to add for 'wig' - you think we cou=
ld put a typical hedwig wig on the ad lady? Or would that be too mainstream=
 ?

Also, assuming this would be a still, we can make a projection of the wall =
at the back that goes from grayscale to colour as that is sort of the mood =
of the song.

Also, between origin of love and wicked town reprise, does anyone have a ch=
oice on which should be the still?

Personally I prefer origin to be the still and wicked town reprise to be th=
e interactive piece. We can do a lot with the fog lights and sounds in wick=

Thanks Yuan!

Looking at the model this evening after you left Mathura, Gustavo and I tho=
ught maybe it is better to put the 'ad screen' on the left, over the bar (w=
here it is now)

On the right it is a bit cramped

Looking at it now I think the car is too small.

Yuan we didnt go into such things very deeply so please feel free to write =
to us which song/s you are most interested in working on!

So as it is right now we have two projection surfaces: the ad screen, and t=
he entire back wall.

Right?

Best

oblem, we would just have to meet there)

but I'll be at ITP from 4-12 on Friday and 5-12 on Saturday. Let me know if=
 you guys are down to meet in either of those times, but I'll still be flex=

Thanks for the update Mathura. Blade Runner sounds great to me, for many re=

 but thursday im very flexible

So we met with Andrew and a huge part of the discussion was about which bac=
k story to use.

We explained both ideas to him to get his opinion.

His thoughts about Truman Show -

It has a good parallel with Hedwig but would require the audience to make a=
n "A to C" that is not too easy.

Thoughts about Blade Runner -

Good scenery to work with and has a lot of elements that would be super hel=
pful for us.

He ultimately sided with Blade Runner.

Personally, I am super excited that we are iterating but feel like by tomor=
row we should decide because we have a LOT more to do post this.

Also, I have been siding with sci-fi and post seeing all the things we can =
do with the projector today, I like the idea of blade runner
So let's decide on the movie soon guys :)

Please feel free to add to things that Andrew said - I'm pretty sure I miss=
ed a lot!

Mathura

Subject: duplicate order
Hello,

My name is Gao. It was my first time ordering from McMaster and apparently
I've made a duplicate order.

The orders, 3059776 and 3059665, were duplicated. I have already paid for
3059776. Can you cancel the other order for me?

Best,
Gao

Hello,

My name is Yuan, currently a first-year student in NYU ITP. I had a
master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University back in
2012, and after working for 3 years I decided to go back to school to
become an artists/designer with a mastery of technology.

I stumbled upon this intern position on Angel.co and I'm very interested in
it. I have pretty good experience in the requirements (shell scripting,
Photoshop, openFrameworks...), as well as many in the Plusses.

I have attached my resume as a pdf, but you can also view it on my
portfolio website: www.ko-yuen.com

Looking forward to hearing from you.


Best,
Yuan Gao
